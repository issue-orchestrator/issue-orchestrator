"""The shared block is governed by the COMPOSITION, not by any one class.

The decorator's own tests prove it refuses a value it was handed. They cannot
prove the composition root hands it to everybody — and every bypass this closed
was a writer that simply never received it. A future omission in ``bootstrap``
would leave those tests green and the hole wide open (#6999 F2 round 6).

So these drive the REAL builder and the REAL public surfaces, against a
CONFIGURED label rather than the default spelling: an AST rule can see
``"blocked-needs-human"``, but nothing static can see a value that only exists
once a repo's configuration is loaded.
