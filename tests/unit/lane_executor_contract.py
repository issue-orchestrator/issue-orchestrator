"""Backend-agnostic contract assertions for the LaneExecutor port.

Every backend adapter must pass these unchanged: they define what
"callers cannot tell backends apart" means. Backend-specific test
modules instantiate :class:`LaneExecutorContract` with a factory for
their adapter and inherit the whole suite.

Waiting here is always waiting on an EVENT the system emits — a pid file
the fixture wrote, a marker on the lane's stdout, a pid the kernel has
stopped knowing about. Every ``*_BACKSTOP_SECONDS`` below exists only to
turn a hang into a failure that NAMES the event that never happened; none
of them is a coordination device, and no assertion is true because a
sleep was long enough (#7148).

    and then raises ``KeyboardInterrupt`` in the main thread with
    ``_thread.interrupt_main``. No signal is delivered to any process, and
    none to any other thread.

    A backstop that only stops WATCHING would leave the run to finish on
    somebody else's clock (round 1, #7148). A lane that is admitted and
    then never dispatched does not reach its own deadline — that clock
    starts at dispatch — so it runs until the backend's admission
    watchdog, ten minutes away, and the enclosing pytest timeout gets
    there first. The operator would then read a generic "test exceeded
    600s" for precisely the failure this suite exists to name. So the

    is what fails, and the lane's job is removed instead of sitting in a

        Three separate things, in order, each waited on as an event:

        1. The tree announces itself (both pids, one atomic record). Until
           that has happened there is nothing to kill, so the lane's own
           deadline is a generous backstop rather than the trigger.
        2. The kill is triggered deliberately, through the cancellation
           path the backends actually implement: an exception in the
           thread that called ``run()``.
        3. Both processes — the parent and its TERM-immune grandchild —
           stop existing. Neither cooperates with SIGTERM, so nothing here
           passes because a process was polite.
