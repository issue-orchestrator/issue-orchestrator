"""Every read of the process table goes through one owner.

``ps`` takes its output width from the environment and truncates the COMMAND
column to it, even into a pipe. That cost PR #7143 a CI failure, and the first
fix — ``-ww`` added by hand at each call site — drifted the same day it was
written: five sites got the flag, three of them kept inheriting ``COLUMNS``,
and a shell script got neither.

So this does not check the five sites we know about. It walks the repository
for ``ps`` invocations and requires each one to come from
``infra/process_table``, so the seventh caller cannot drift either.
