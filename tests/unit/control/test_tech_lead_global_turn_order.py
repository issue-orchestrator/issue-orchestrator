"""Two queued globals take their turn in ONE order (#6994 round 5 F16/A9).

The local launch gate used to elect ``global_queued[0]`` — whichever global the
repository scan happened to return first — while the shared ledger elected by
its own durable order. Nothing made those agree, and a perfectly ordinary crash
recovery could leave them permanently at odds: the gate offered health, the
ledger insisted batch was ahead, every renewal preserved the disagreement, and
because a queued global is a barrier NOTHING in the repository launched again.

The fix gives both consumers one authority
(:func:`...domain.tech_lead_run.global_run_precedence`), so these tests recover
the queue in the WRONG order on purpose and prove the durable winner still goes
first, the loser goes next, and targeted work is barred only until the globals
drain.

Deterministic throughout: a hand-advanced clock, an explicit shared ledger, and
a tick that is a function call rather than a thread.
