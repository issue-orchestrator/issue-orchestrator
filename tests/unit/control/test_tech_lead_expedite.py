"""Tech-lead expedite lane (#6870): owner cap, gate inheritance, promotion.

Covers both sides of the command surface:
  * producer -> the create-issue applier reads ``action.expedite`` + gate and
    routes the follow-up through the ExpediteLane owner (execute now / propose
    deferred);
  * consumer -> RetryHistoryState performs the bounded front-queue write and the
    un-gate promotion.
