"""Every MUTATING tech-lead command crosses the reconciliation gate (#6957).

Round-5 review F15/A6 wrapped the four commands whose reconciliation subjects
the dispatch table happened to spell out by hand. Round-6 F3/A3 found the
consequence: issue CREATION — the largest mutation of the lot — was not one of
them, so a case file or gated proposal could still be filed against a source
anchor paused behind ``io:needs-reconcile``.

A hand-maintained subject table is the defect. These tests pin the replacement:
the subject belongs to each command, and the wrapper is applied mechanically to
the complete mutating set — so a new tech-lead command cannot be added
unguarded, and one that names no subject cannot carry expectations either.
