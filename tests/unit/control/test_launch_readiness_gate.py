"""Every launch flavor defers while the callback endpoint is unresolved.

An agent spawned before the endpoint is published gets a completion
environment with no way to reach the orchestrator: every callback it
makes fails, and the round runner reads the resulting silence as an
unresponsive agent — which is how completed, validated work ended up
stranded (#6913, #6924).

The rule first lived only in ``_check_launch_preconditions``, which
review, retrospective-review and rework launches never reach, so those
three flavors could still launch into the unresolved window (F7-R3).
These tests pin the behaviour per path — that the launcher actually
defers — not merely that the endpoint object reports unready.
