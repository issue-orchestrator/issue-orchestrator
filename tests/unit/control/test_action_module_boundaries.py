"""The action modules' dependency direction is one-way (#6957 review F7).

``actions`` imports ``tech_lead_actions`` and re-exports every name from it, so
``tech_lead_actions`` must NOT import ``actions`` back. It used to: the reverse
import only worked because ``Action``/``ActionType`` happened to be bound on the
partially initialized module before the forward import ran, which made a
harmless import reordering able to break module initialization.

``action_base`` is the dependency root. These tests pin that, statically (so
they fail on the import statement itself rather than on a lucky runtime order)
and dynamically (so a fresh, isolated import of the leaf module still works).
