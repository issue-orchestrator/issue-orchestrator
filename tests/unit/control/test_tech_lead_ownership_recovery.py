"""Restart and ownership-loss reconciliation (#6994 round 2 F4).

Round 1 collapsed three different facts into one word. A restarted engine with
no lease bookkeeping re-acquired every recovered run, and ANY refusal — a live
peer, its OWN unexpired pre-crash lease, or a GitHub read that simply failed —
came back as "lost". The consequences were both directions of wrong: a
recovered global anchor was withdrawn and never retried (stranded until the next
restart), while an ACTIVE session whose ownership had genuinely gone to a peer
was left running, because only queue entries were ever removed.

So reconciliation is typed now, and each status has its own consequence:

* ``CONTENDED`` — retain and retry until the hold lapses or is adopted;
* ``LOST`` — withdraw the queued run AND stop the running session;
* ``UNAVAILABLE`` — change nothing; a transport failure is not evidence.

Every case below is deterministic: one shared ledger cell, a hand-advanced
clock, and recorded terminations instead of real ones.
