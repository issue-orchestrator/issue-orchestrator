"""Termination releases BOTH coordination holds (#6994 round 2 F10 / A7).

The one-shot driver terminates a timed-out session and then runs NO further
tick, so whatever termination does not clean up is never cleaned up. Round 2
released the per-issue claim but left the repository-wide RUN hold live, which
meant a timed-out whole-repository review kept every conflicting tech-lead run
blocked until its lease expired — for a command that had already exited.

These tests drive the REAL one-shot timeout path against a REAL shared run
ledger, so "the hold is gone" is observed in the ledger rather than asserted
about a mock. The clock and the drive loop are injected, so nothing sleeps.
