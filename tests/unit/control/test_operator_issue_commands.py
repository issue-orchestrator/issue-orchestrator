"""The operator retry/dismiss transition, at the owner (#6999 F5/A2).

The endpoint tests in ``tests/unit/test_control_api_issue_actions.py`` cover the
other side of the boundary — that the transport maps this command's typed
outcome and does nothing else. These cover the invariant itself, which is what
actually went wrong: local retry/queue state may only be settled once the GitHub
side of the transition committed, and a refusal must leave BOTH untouched.
