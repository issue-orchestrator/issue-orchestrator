"""Every tech-lead launch goes through ONE authority (#6994 round 2 F2 / A2).

Round 1 had two launch paths with two different authorities. The tick reached
the launch through the planner, which consulted the scope gate against a
snapshot taken BEFORE that same tick's actions ran; the one-shot CLI called
``launch_tech_lead_session`` directly and consulted nothing at all. Both are
represented here, because "the gate exists" and "the gate cannot be bypassed"
are different claims and only the second one is worth anything.

Everything is deterministic: a hand-advanced clock, an explicit shared ledger,
and a launch callable that RECORDS rather than launches — so "did the session
start?" is a fact, not an inference.
