"""A queued tech-lead investigation is revalidated before it launches (#6994).

Admission is not a standing licence to launch. A run can sit queued for many
ticks — behind the global barrier, behind capacity, behind an open provider
circuit — and in that window a human can close or unblock its subject. These
tests pin the end-to-end consequence: the planner withdraws such a run instead
of launching it, and the apply seam actually removes it from the queue.

Withdrawal (rather than holding) is the point. The pending queue is a failure
investigation's ONLY durable record, so a run that can never launch would
otherwise sit there forever, keeping the dashboard's "Tech lead queued"
affordance lit on an issue that has nothing left to investigate.
