"""Two-engine test doubles for the shared tech-lead run ledger (#6994).

Deliberately NOT a hand-written stub of the conflict matrix. The whole point of
the ledger is that ONE pure function decides what conflicts with what, so a
double that re-implemented the matrix would prove the tests pass rather than
prove the rule holds. :class:`SharedRunLedger` therefore evaluates the real
:func:`issue_orchestrator.domain.run_ledger.resolve` over one shared cell, and
each engine gets a store view with its own claimant identity — which is exactly
the shape two Repository Engines coordinating through one GitHub ref have.

The clock is injected and never real, so every cross-engine ordering, lease
expiry, and adoption case is deterministic.
