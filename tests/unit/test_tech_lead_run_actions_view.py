"""The dashboard's tech-lead affordances project live run state (#6994).

The projection is the producer half of the command surface: the route decides
whether a run may start, and this decides what the operator sees before they
click. Both must read the SAME notion of "a global run" — a projection that
disagreed would show an enabled button the server then refuses (or hide one it
would have accepted), which is exactly the drift the run-admission owner exists
to prevent.
