"""Validate OS-level invariants for setpgrp-based process isolation.

These tests codify assumptions about how setpgrp interacts with PTYs,
process groups, and signal delivery. If any of these fail on a new OS or
platform, the SubprocessPlugin ↔ AgentRunner output capture chain will break.

The core invariant: os.setpgrp() creates a new process GROUP while keeping
the process in the same session. This means:
  - The child keeps its controlling terminal (PTY output flows to parent)
  - killpg() can target the child's process group without hitting the parent
  - This is NOT the same as os.setsid() which creates a new session and
    disconnects from the controlling terminal

Why this matters:
  SubprocessPlugin uses pexpect (PTY) to capture session output.
  AgentRunner spawns the agent command as a subprocess.
  If the agent runs in a new session (setsid), it loses the PTY and falls
  into non-interactive/print mode. Output never reaches pexpect.
  With setpgrp, the agent stays connected to the PTY and output flows.
