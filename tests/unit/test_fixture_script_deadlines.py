"""Every fixture script this repo spawns must die of its own clock.

Cleanup in a ``finally`` protects a harness that gets to run its ``finally``.
It does nothing for a harness that is SIGKILLed, loses power, or is torn down
by a pytest timeout — and the 2026-08-29 leak (#7142) is exactly what the
machine looks like afterwards. So each fixture carries an independent deadline,
and this module reproduces the escape to prove it: start the fixture, kill its
supervisor outright, and require the orphan to be gone on time.

Two separate properties, deliberately not merged:

* the *mechanism* — the script honours the deadline it is handed, tested with a
  short one so the suite stays fast;
* the *policy* — every lifetime any fixture is spawned with is finite and
  measured in minutes.

The policy half **discovers** lifetimes rather than listing them. A
hand-maintained list is a list someone forgets to extend: the first draft of
this module checked four constants and missed a ``time.sleep(600)`` lane job in
a file it already imported from. The scan below walks the whole test tree for
the shapes that produce a fixture process, so a new one is in budget or it
fails here — it cannot slide by not being mentioned.

TERM-immunity is re-asserted alongside, because a fixture that quietly started
cooperating with SIGTERM would make the contract tests that use it vacuous.

Error model, stated so it stops being re-traded
-----------------------------------------------

This is an induction test, so the two ways it can be wrong are not equal:

* a **false negative** is a real fixture with no ceiling, sliding through
  silently — the failure this module exists to prevent;
* a **false positive** is a line of prose flagged as a fixture, which someone
  reads, disagrees with, and puts in ``LIFETIME_ALLOWLIST`` with a reason.

One is a leak; the other is a decision on the record. So the scan
deliberately over-includes, and ``LIFETIME_ALLOWLIST`` is the escape — for
genuine prose exactly as much as for a justified long-running fixture.

The temptation each round is to tighten the rule until the noise stops. That
trade was made once already, by requiring a recognisable interpreter beside
``-c``, and it bought a quieter scan at the price of missing ``python3 -uc``.
Tighten *shapes* (what counts as a docstring, what parses as code); do not
tighten *reach* (which strings are examined at all) without moving the missed
fixtures somewhere they are still caught.

Two contexts, and they are not the same
---------------------------------------

A fixture spells its invocation one of two ways, and what counts as valid
differs between them. Collapsing the two is how an accepted invocation got
called impossible:

* a **command string** -- ``f"{sys.executable} -c 'import time; ...'"`` -- is
  split by a shell before Python sees it. A script attached with no quotes
  cannot survive that split: ``python -cimport time; time.sleep(9)`` arrives
  as ``-cimport`` plus stray words, and Python reports a SyntaxError.
* an **argv element** -- ``[sys.executable, "-cimport time; time.sleep(9)"]``
  -- is handed to the OS verbatim. Nothing splits it, so the attachment is
  real and CPython runs it.

The second was missed for exactly as long as the rejection was "proved" by
running the first through ``shlex.split``. Both rules are pinned by tests that
ask the real interpreter, in the shape the fixture would actually use.
