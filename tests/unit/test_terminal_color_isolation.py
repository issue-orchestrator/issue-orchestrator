"""Rich output under test must not vary with the shell that launched pytest.

Guards the fix for #7155, where ``FORCE_COLOR=3`` in an agent shell made six
CLI tests fail — twice over, once from ANSI markup splitting an expected
substring and once from rich adopting the real terminal width and wrapping a
line mid-assertion.

The in-process tests below pin the fixture's contract. The subprocess test is
the one that actually reproduces the reported bug: it runs the originally
failing tests in a child pytest whose environment carries ``FORCE_COLOR``,
which is the only way to exercise a fixture that strips it before any test in
this process can observe it.

    What it does NOT prove, despite an earlier version of this docstring

    ``isolate_terminal_color_env`` leaves every other test in this file

    and pins ``COLUMNS`` before collection, so the child is protected with or
    without the fixture.

    The two mechanisms cover different things and both are wanted: the
    module-level block fixes consoles built during collection (which is most
    of them, since test modules import the CLI at module scope), and the
    fixture stops one test's environment changes leaking into the next. The
