    pipe read to obtain a string the test wrote moments earlier.

    That fork is what makes this file load-fragile. It is bounded by the

    correct in production and merciless in a test: on a machine running the

    ending -> cleanup -> ending loop while every assertion in this file
    still passed — a test that could not fail on the property it claimed.

    Cycle detection is PATH-LOCAL: a node revisited on its own path is a
    cycle, but the same exception reachable by two different paths is a
    diamond, which is legitimate and is exactly what round 6 produces (the
    ending is both the explicit ``__cause__`` of the second interrupt and
    the implicit context of the cleanup failure). A global "seen" set would
    reject that valid shape.

    Iterative rather than recursive: a valid chain is not bounded by
    anything this file controls, and a recursive walk raised RecursionError
    on a 2,000-link acyclic chain — a helper failing on VALID input is the
    same vacuity in the other direction. ``active`` is the current path
    (the cycle test), ``completed`` is everything fully explored, which
    both accepts diamonds without re-walking them and keeps this linear.

    Keyed by ``id``, holding the exceptions as the values, and those are
    ONE decision rather than two. A cause/context graph is made of
    references, so its nodes are distinguished by identity: keying on the
    exceptions themselves would consult ``__eq__``, and two distinct
    instances that compare equal would then read as a single node and
    report a cycle that is not there. Identity keys are only safe while
    the objects cannot be collected and have their ids reused, which is
    exactly why the values are the exceptions — retaining them is what
