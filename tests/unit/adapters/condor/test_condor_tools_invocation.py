"""The tool boundary's contract, and its deliberate asymmetry.

``CondorTools`` is the single place this package runs a scheduler
tool, which makes it the single place that decides what environment
those tools see. It answers two different questions and the
environment rule differs by question:

- ``read_configuration`` asks ABOUT the pool, so the pool must be what
  answers: per-process macro overrides are scrubbed, or an ambient
  export could decide what the policy check believes.
- ``invoke`` runs the submit/remove/query tools, and the submit
  description sets ``getenv = true`` — the environment handed to
  ``condor_submit`` is the environment the LANE inherits. Carrying it
  faithfully is the contract, so nothing is scrubbed there.

Both halves are pinned here; the asymmetry is the design, not drift.
