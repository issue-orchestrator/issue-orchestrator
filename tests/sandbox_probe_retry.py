"""Retry policy for the live sandbox boundary probes.

The OS-boundary probes in ``tests/integration/test_sandbox_os_boundary.py``
drive a real agent CLI, so under a loaded parallel run an attempt can blow its
deadline without the sandbox having misbehaved. Retrying once is legitimate;
*forgetting that an attempt timed out* is not — a timed-out attempt may have
created some or all of the expected result files before it was killed, and
treating "the files exist" as success would let a half-executed security probe
report a pass.

This module owns that distinction so no probe can accidentally re-derive it:

- A timed-out attempt **never** satisfies the success condition, even when
  every expected path is already present on disk.
- Every attempt's output and on-disk evidence is captured, so the caller's
  breach assertions still run against a run that ultimately timed out.
- Exhausting the retries on a timeout fails loudly via
  :meth:`ProbeRun.require_completed`, restoring the pre-retry behaviour where
  a ``TimeoutExpired`` aborted the test.
