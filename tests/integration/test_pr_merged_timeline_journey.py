"""Agent journey: when a PR is merged, the user-facing timeline must
show a "PR merged" event.

Background
----------
Before this test landed, ``EventName.REVIEW_MERGED`` was defined in
the catalog, had an ``EventSpec`` (phase=reviewing/step=merged), was in
the view registry mapped to the user view with narrative "PR merged",
was in the issue-detail view models — yet **nothing in production
actually published it**. The closest emitter was
``_apply_reconcile_history_entry`` in ``control/action_applier.py``,
which emitted ``HISTORY_RECONCILED`` (an ops/debug-only record) when
the awaiting-merge reconciler discovered ``pr_state == "merged"``.

The result: a real session that successfully merged its PR ended with
the user-facing timeline silent on the merge — the entire downstream
rendering pipeline was prepared for the event, but the event never
arrived. Goldens didn't catch this because no scenario emitted the
event in the first place.

What this test pins
-------------------
The journey from "awaiting-merge reconciler detects a merged PR" to
"user reads `PR merged` on their dashboard timeline":

  - Driving ``ReconcileHistoryEntryAction(status="merged")`` through
    the action applier publishes both ``HISTORY_RECONCILED`` (record
    of work) AND ``REVIEW_MERGED`` (user-facing event).
  - Flowing those events through the production write path
    (``DefaultTimelineWriter`` → ``produce_external_records`` fan-out
    → ``TimelineStore``) and projecting via ``project_timeline``
    yields a ``review.merged`` event in the user view.
  - That event carries the canonical "PR merged" narrative, so a
    human or agent skimming the dashboard sees the merge at a glance.
  - A close-without-merge reconciliation does NOT produce a
    ``review.merged`` event in the user view (regression guard
    against false positives).
