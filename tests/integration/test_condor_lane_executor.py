# OBSERVING a status does not hold the world still. A holder on its own fixed
# clock stops holding the exclusive token while the test is still assembling
# the contention it needs — and assembling it is not free, since constructing
# an executor alone runs a scheduler reachability query that is allowed 30s.
# When the token frees early the contender never queues, and the test then
# fails as though the property had (measured by the reviewer against a scaled
# backend: ``queue_wait=0.0s``, ``never reached JobStatus 1``).
#
# So the holder waits for an acknowledgment this test writes, and this test
# writes it only once every contender is OBSERVABLY queued behind the token.
# Announce, then act — the same shape as the tree fixture's readiness record.
