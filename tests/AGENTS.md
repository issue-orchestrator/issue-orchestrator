# Testing Principles

## Determinism Required

**Deterministic tests only.** Any timing-based coordination is forbidden.

- Do **not** use `sleep` (including `asyncio.sleep`) to “wait for” work.
- Do **not** rely on “eventually” semantics, background timing, or real clocks.
- Do use deterministic control points: explicit callbacks, single-tick helpers, mocked time, or injected schedulers.
- If a test can flake under load or on CI, it’s wrong—fix the test, not the timeout.
- Exception: tests that must wait on **real external systems** may use bounded waits, but should still prefer explicit readiness/ack signals over sleeps.

## Test Behavior, Not Implementation

**The cardinal rule**: Tests should verify WHAT the code does, not HOW it does it.

When you test implementation details (private methods, internal state), you:
- Couple tests to code structure, so refactoring breaks tests
- Miss actual bugs because you're testing the wrong thing
- Create maintenance burden as implementation evolves

### The Litmus Test

Before writing a test, ask: **"Would a user of this code care about this?"**

- If yes → test it through the public API
- If no → don't test it directly (it's an implementation detail)

## Typed Run Assets in Tests

- Active session/completion/review-exchange tests must construct and inject
  typed run assets such as `SessionRunAssets` or `ReviewExchangeRunAssets`.
- Do not omit required run assets from positive-path test sessions. Missing
  `run_dir` belongs only in explicit negative tests that assert fail-fast
  behavior.
- Prefer builders/fakes that fail when production code attempts fallback
  discovery. A passing test must not depend on "latest run" lookup,
  session-name scans, alternate-name recovery, or worktree rummaging.

## Never Access Private Members (`_xxx`)

**Do not access `_private` members in tests.** This is enforced by ruff's SLF001 rule.

If you find yourself needing to access a private member, stop and ask why:

| Smell | What It Means | Fix |
|-------|---------------|-----|
| `obj._method()` | Testing implementation | Test through public API instead |
| `obj._cache.set(...)` | Missing dependency injection | Inject the collaborator |
| `assert obj._state == X` | Testing internal state | Test observable outcome |
| `obj._flag = False` | Missing configuration surface | Make it a constructor param |

### Example: Testing Cache Behavior

```python
# BAD - Reaches into internals
def test_cache_stores_labels(self, adapter):
    adapter.get_issue_labels(42)
    cached = adapter._cache.get_issue_labels(42)  # SLF001 violation!
    assert cached == ["bug"]

# GOOD - Tests observable behavior
def test_subsequent_calls_use_cache(self, adapter, mock_http):
    adapter.get_issue_labels(42)  # First call hits API
    adapter.get_issue_labels(42)  # Second call should use cache
    assert mock_http.get_issue_labels.call_count == 1  # Only one API call
```

### Example: Testing Helper Methods

```python
# BAD - Tests private helper directly
def test_build_labels(self, orchestrator):
    labels = orchestrator._build_labels("agent:web")  # SLF001 violation!
    assert labels == ["agent:web", "test-data"]

# GOOD - Tests through public behavior
def test_session_labels_include_filter(self, orchestrator, mock_github):
    orchestrator.start_session(issue)
    # Verify the labels that were actually applied
    call_args = mock_github.add_labels.call_args
    assert "test-data" in call_args[0][1]
```

---

## Dependency Injection Over Internal Access

If a test needs to control or observe a collaborator, that collaborator should be **injected**, not accessed internally.

```python
# BAD - Test manipulates internal collaborator
def test_with_cache_disabled(self, adapter):
    adapter._cache_enabled = False  # Reaching into internals
    ...

# GOOD - Collaborator is injected
def test_with_cache_disabled(self):
    adapter = GitHubAdapter(cache_enabled=False)  # Configuration at construction
    ...

# BETTER - Cache is a separate injectable dependency
def test_cache_behavior(self):
    cache = InMemoryCache()
    cache.set_issue_labels(42, ["bug"])
    adapter = GitHubAdapter(cache=cache)  # Inject the collaborator
    ...
```

---

## What to Test

### DO Test
- **Public method behavior** - Given inputs, verify outputs/effects
- **Error handling** - Given bad inputs, verify appropriate errors
- **State transitions** - Given action, verify observable state change
- **Integration points** - Verify collaborators are called correctly (via mocks)

### DON'T Test
- **Private methods directly** - They're implementation details
- **Internal state** - Test observable outcomes instead
- **How something works** - Test what it does

---

## Mock at Port Boundaries

This codebase uses hexagonal architecture. Mock at the **port** level, not inside implementations.

```python
# BAD - Patching deep internals
with patch('issue_orchestrator.execution.github_http.GitHubHttpClient'):
    ...

# GOOD - Mock the port interface
mock_github_adapter.get_issue_labels.return_value = ["bug"]
orchestrator = create_orchestrator(github=mock_github_adapter)
```

See `tests/unit/conftest.py` for pre-built mock adapters.

---

## When You Can't Test Without Private Access

If you genuinely can't verify behavior without accessing internals, this signals a design issue:

1. **Extract a collaborator** - The private thing should be its own class with a public interface
2. **Add observability** - The class needs a way to report its state publicly
3. **Question the test** - Maybe this behavior doesn't need explicit testing

**Never "fix" this by making `_private` → `public`.** The author marked it private for a reason. Fix the design, not the visibility.

---

## Test Pyramid: Prefer Integration over Browser

**Default to the cheapest layer that can prove the behavior.** Playwright tests are slow (~7s/test) and flaky-prone; treat them as a scarce resource.

| Layer | Cost | Use for |
|-------|------|---------|
| Python unit | <50 ms | Pure logic, parsers, view-model shape, port behavior |
| **JS-vm** (`tests/js/`, `node:test` + `vm`) | **<5 ms** | **JS rendering, click dispatch, fetch behavior, command-pattern handlers** |
| Python integration | <500 ms | HTTP endpoints (`TestClient`), SQLite-backed flows, multi-component wiring |
| Playwright (`tests/e2e_web/`) | ~7 s | True browser concerns only |

### When to use Playwright (and when NOT to)

**Use Playwright for:**
- Cross-page navigation, modal lifecycle, focus management
- Real DOM events the JS-vm can't simulate (paint timing, layout, drag/drop, file pickers)
- One end-to-end smoke per major surface, proving the wiring (view-model → API → JS → DOM) actually works in a real browser

**Do NOT use Playwright for:**
- Verifying which handler fires when a button is clicked → JS-vm test of the dispatch function
- Verifying HTML structure (pills, classes, attributes) → JS-vm test asserting on rendered string
- Verifying API request shape on click → JS-vm test with stubbed `fetch`
- Verifying error/empty states → JS-vm test with the matching response stub

### The command pattern lets you skip Playwright

Click handlers in this codebase route through dispatch contracts (`data-e2e-action`, `data-lifecycle-command`, `data-artifact-path`) rather than inline closures. Tests at the JS-vm layer call the dispatcher directly with a synthetic button (`{ dataset: {...} }`) and assert on which window-scoped helper got called and with what arguments — no DOM, no browser.

Reference: `tests/js/e2e_run_view_actions.test.js` covers every clickable surface in `e2e_run_view.js` (row actions, lifecycle commands, artifact buttons, filter chips, row toggle, lazy-load) at the dispatch layer. New click surfaces should be tested there first; only escalate to Playwright if the test genuinely needs a browser.

### Substring guardrails are a backstop, not a primary

`tests/unit/test_dashboard_ui_guardrails.py` greps function bodies for specific strings ("must contain `data-needs-fetch`"). It catches accidental deletion of structural patterns but doesn't verify behavior — a typo or wrong wiring still passes substring checks. Use it sparingly for cross-cutting structural rules ("filter dispatch is panel-scoped, not global"); per-handler behavior belongs in `tests/js/`.
