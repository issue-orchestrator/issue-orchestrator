# test-vscode (the real VS Code extension harness), which self-skips on GitHub
# Actions, so packages/vscode has no CI coverage at all. This target is the only
# place the npm bucket is actually exercised before it lands.
#
# Python majors arrive automatically -- pyproject pins with `>=`, so
# `uv lock --upgrade` already crosses major boundaries. npm ranges are `^`, so
# npm majors need MAJOR=1, which rewrites package.json ranges via
# npm-check-updates.
#
# MAJOR=1 is not a rubber stamp: npm-check-updates targets absolute latest, which
# can overshoot what Dependabot proposes (and can bump runtime deps Dependabot
# left alone). Read the package.json diff before committing it, and keep
# @types/vscode at or below the `engines.vscode` floor -- raising it above the
# declared minimum lets the extension compile against APIs that are not present
# in the oldest VS Code we claim to support.
