"""Persistent-session review-exchange runner.

Drives a coder↔reviewer review exchange where each role is one persistent
agent process — opened at exchange start, prompted once per round via
``send_round``, and terminated explicitly at exchange end. The PTY for
each role captures one continuous ``terminal-recording.jsonl`` spanning
every round of the exchange, plus a ``chapters.json`` sidecar that marks
each prompt/feedback boundary so the session viewer can scrub straight
to "where the reviewer's round-2 comments start."

The reviewer runs in a separate worktree from the coder; the caller is
responsible for creating that worktree before invoking this runner and
removing it after. Between rounds the caller may inject a
``before_reviewer_round`` callback to e.g. fast-forward the reviewer
worktree to the coder's branch tip.

This module owns the round-loop semantics — validation gating,
no-progress termination, and event emission.

class _RoleAttemptWorkspace:
    """Owns the on-disk artifact freshness for one role's turn.

    A single role turn may run more than one process attempt: the initial
    send, a coder protocol retry, or an in-place respawn after the process
    died (see :func:`_send_role_round`). Every attempt must start from a clean
    artifact workspace, or the exchange can pair/validate a side artifact
    written by a now-dead process against the response JSON produced by a
    later one.

    The pair-scoped paths are stable across rounds and attempts, so a process
    can write its side artifact — a reviewer ``review-report.md`` or a coder
    ``completion-coder.json`` — and then exit *before* writing the response
    JSON. A respawned process would then produce only the response JSON, and
    the exchange would consume the dead process's stale side artifact (e.g.
    publish a report from attempt A with a decision from attempt B, or let a
    coder advance without having run ``coding-done`` this attempt).

    Centralizing the reset here — instead of scattering role-specific cleanup
    across the round loop plus a respawn special case — keeps artifact
    freshness under one owner. The caller constructs this with the role's
    pieces up front; :func:`_send_role_round` calls
    :meth:`prepare_for_attempt` before every attempt and never inspects role
    names or filenames itself.

    For the coder, clearing the completion artifact is what makes a respawned
    turn unable to ride a dead attempt's validation: validation is only
    mirrored into pair scope from a completion produced during the turn (see
    :meth:`_PairValidationMirror.refresh_from_completion`), and a missing
    completion fails the protocol guardrail outright.

    """Capture the recording's current event index, append a chapter,
    emit ``REVIEW_EXCHANGE_CHAPTER_RECORDED``, and (when ``mirror`` is
    provided) project the new events into the per-session run_dir slice.

    Returns the captured ``event_index`` so callers can chain behavior
    onto it without having to count the recording themselves. The
    returned value is **always pair-relative** so callers tracking
    exchange-wide event progression see absolute positions; the
    chapter sidecar and the SSE payload, by contrast, hold the
    slice-relative offset (when a ``mirror`` is provided) because the
    manifest points the viewer at the slice file.

    Errors propagate. Role recordings are created at session open and the
    chapter offset is the UI contract for scrubbing the persistent
    recording — a missing recording or failed sidecar write means the
    replay contract is broken, not a best-effort detail. The top-level
    ``run_persistent_session_exchange`` handler converts the propagated
    exception into a REVIEW_EXCHANGE_FAILED event and re-raises so the
    orchestrator surface treats it as a definitive exchange failure.

    The chapter event is emitted *after* the sidecar write succeeds so
    SSE/timeline consumers see the same offset that's now durable on disk;
    on failure the exception propagates and no event fires (consistent
    with the rest of the runner's emit-on-success contract).

    Per-event slice mirroring is no longer chapter-driven — the role's
    ``MirroredTerminalRecordingWriter`` writes to both the pair file
    and the per-session slice on every event drained from the PTY,
    so chapters only own offset translation here.
