"""In-memory adapter for ``PersistentExchangePairRegistry``.

Owned by the composition root (one instance per orchestrator process)
and shared across all review-exchange invocations. Tear-down is wired
into orchestrator shutdown so no PTY-attached agent processes leak
when the orchestrator stops.

This module also defines :class:`PersistentExchangePair`, the value
type the adapter caches and returns from :meth:`acquire`. The
dataclass and ``acquire`` live in execution/ on purpose: they
reference :class:`PersistentSession` (a subprocess-backed handle),
which the port boundary forbids exposing. Control-layer callers
that only need the ``release`` / ``shutdown_all`` lifecycle verbs
depend on the narrow port; execution-layer callers that need
``acquire`` import this concrete adapter directly.

ADR 0026 documents the design and migration plan.

class PersistentExchangePair:
    """One issue's coder + reviewer subprocess pair plus its reviewer worktree.

    Lives in execution/ so the dataclass can name
    :class:`PersistentSession` directly without violating the port
    boundary. Returned by :meth:`InMemoryPersistentExchangePairRegistry.acquire`
    to execution-layer callers.

    Pair write paths are pair-lifetime scoped. Agent-written response/report
    paths live inside the role worktrees so sandboxed agents can write them;
    recordings and coder completion/validation paths live under the persistent
    pair root. ``exchange_run_id`` and ``run_dir`` record the current typed
    exchange run consuming those stable pair-scoped writes; the pair contract
    owner rebinds them on each exchange acquire.

    ``created_at`` is wall-clock seconds since epoch, set once at
    construction. ``last_used_at`` is updated on every cache hit so
    future diagnostics / idle-reaping can see when the pair was
    last touched. The dataclass is mutable so the registry can
    update ``last_used_at`` in place.

    The registry owns cache membership and pair teardown via
    ``release`` / ``shutdown_all``. Once a pair is acquired for a
    single exchange, the execution-layer role-session owner may
    replace ``coder_session`` or ``reviewer_session`` after a role
    process exits following a valid turn. That owner preserves the
    pair-scoped worktree/path contract while swapping the active
    subprocess handle. Registry snapshots are diagnostics-only and
    may observe either side of that atomic reference swap during the
    handoff.

    The implementation deliberately does not own the reviewer
    worktree's filesystem layout — ``release`` invokes the

    so worktree removal can call into the existing reviewer-worktree
