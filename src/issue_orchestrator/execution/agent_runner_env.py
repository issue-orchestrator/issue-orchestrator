"""Environment variable filtering for agent security.

This module provides functions to prepare isolated environments for agent sessions:
- Scrub forbidden environment variables (credentials, tokens)
- Set safe git environment variables
- Build filtered environment dictionaries

Security principle: Agents should not *accidentally* inherit credentials
that could let them perform privileged operations. This is hygiene — it
reduces surprise and blocks unsophisticated misuse — not isolation.

Scope note: scrubbing an env var does NOT stop an agent from reading
the same credential off the filesystem. Same-user agents still share
HOME (``terminal_subprocess.py`` keeps ``isolate_home=False``), so for
example ``ISSUE_ORCHESTRATOR_API_TOKEN`` is stripped from the agent
env but the admin token file remains readable at
``~/.issue-orchestrator/api-token``. Real containment requires
OS-level separation (separate user, container, sandbox). Tracked as
issue #6024.
