"""Persistent-PTY round runner for review-exchange.

Replaces the single-shot ``interactive_round`` flow for review-exchange
agents. One agent process is attached to a master/slave PTY pair at
exchange start and stays alive across all rounds. Each round:

  - ``send_round`` deletes any stale response file, writes the prompt to
    the master fd, then submits it with a standalone ``\r`` (Enter) once
    the echo settles (see ``send_round``), and polls for the response file.
  - PTY output is captured continuously into a single recording — the
    session viewer plays one ``terminal-recording.jsonl`` per role
    spanning the whole exchange, instead of N per-phase files.

At exchange end, ``close_session`` sends ``SIGTERM`` to the agent's
process group and waits for it to exit. Closing the master fd alone is
not reliable — the spike showed Claude-shaped TUIs do not always exit
cleanly on stdin EOF.

    The response source is selected by ``response_reader``: ``None`` (default)
    polls ``response_file`` on disk (stale files are cleared first); when
    provided, the loop polls that callable (the orchestrator-owned
    ``TurnMailbox``, fed by ``exchange-respond``) and touches no file. The PTY
    pumping, exit/idle detection, and heartbeats are identical either way.

    A response file that exists but does not yet parse as JSON is treated
    as still-being-written: the loop keeps polling until the JSON parses,
    the agent exits, or the deadline expires. Without this tolerance, a
    non-atomic write from the agent (open, write opening brace, flush,
    write the rest) would race the orchestrator and surface as a fatal
    protocol error on the very first poll.

    ``role_label`` is a short tag (``coder`` / ``reviewer``) included in
    log messages so an interleaved coder + reviewer log is decodable
    without cross-referencing PIDs.

    ``write_timeout_seconds`` bounds only the initial prompt write. The
    effective write deadline is capped by ``timeout_seconds`` so a short
    total round timeout remains authoritative.

    ``prompt_acceptance_idle_seconds`` bounds how long a prompted session may
    stay alive without producing any PTY/recording activity or response after
    prompt delivery. This catches the "prompt rendered, agent never engaged"
    failure mode before the full round timeout.

    ``on_idle_detector`` (when supplied) is handed the round's live
