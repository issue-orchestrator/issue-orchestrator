"""Persistent-PTY round runner for review-exchange.

Replaces the single-shot ``interactive_round`` flow for review-exchange
agents. One agent process is attached to a master/slave PTY pair at
exchange start and stays alive across all rounds. Each round:

  - ``send_round`` deletes any stale response file, writes the prompt to
    the master fd, then submits it with a standalone ``\r`` (Enter) once
    the echo settles (see ``send_round``), and polls for the response file.
  - PTY output is captured continuously into a single recording — the
    session viewer plays one ``terminal-recording.jsonl`` per role
    spanning the whole exchange, instead of N per-phase files.

At exchange end, ``close_session`` sends ``SIGTERM`` to the agent's
process group and waits for it to exit. Closing the master fd alone is
not reliable — the spike showed Claude-shaped TUIs do not always exit
cleanly on stdin EOF.
