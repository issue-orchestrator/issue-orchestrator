"""Provider error classification for agent-runner.

Classifies provider failures into coarse categories for retry/circuit logic.

This module holds **the** classification table (#6999). Interactive TUI
providers, the one-shot ``provider_runner`` wrapper, the launch-time readiness
probe, and live-session diagnosis all classify through here — no consumer keeps
a private token list, so "what does an auth failure look like" has one owner.

# An exhausted balance or usage allowance. Distinct from an ordinary rate
# limit because the provider has reported that a capacity meter is empty, not
# merely that requests should back off; distinct from AUTH because the
# credential is valid. Whether the meter refills on a clock is carried by the
# billing-aware ProviderLane: prepaid subscription windows receive a deadline,
# while metered balances wait for successful-call evidence. Codex's primary
# quota banner is "You've hit your usage limit …
# purchase more credits", and its typed variants are
# ``usage_limit_exceeded`` / ``workspace_member_credits_depleted``. None of
# them contain "rate limit", "429", "quota", or "throttle", so every one of
# them classified as ``None`` and fell through every consumer (#7096).
#
# Matched ahead of the rate-limit table: these phrases are the more specific
# reading, and misfiling exhaustion as a rate limit is the failure mode that
# retried an out-of-credits account until its budget was gone. The bare token
# "quota" deliberately stays with the rate-limit table — reclassifying strings
# that already had a working classification is a separate question from
# covering strings that had none.

    # ordinary reasoning. A false positive here is expensive — quota trips on
    # the first observation and has no readiness probe, so without another
    # in-flight success it parks the provider for the full cooldown. Each phrase
    # below is long enough that an agent discussing the topic is unlikely to
