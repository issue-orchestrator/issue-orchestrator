"""Provider error classification for agent-runner.

Classifies provider failures into coarse categories for retry/circuit logic.

This module holds **the** classification table (#6999). Interactive TUI
providers, the one-shot ``provider_runner`` wrapper, the launch-time readiness
probe, and live-session diagnosis all classify through here — no consumer keeps
a private token list, so "what does an auth failure look like" has one owner.
