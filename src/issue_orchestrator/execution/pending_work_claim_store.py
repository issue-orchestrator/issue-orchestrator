"""SQLite-backed, orchestrator-owned pending-work ledger (#6999 F7/F8/F11/F12).

Lives in the repository's orchestrator state directory, NOT in the session
worktree. The worktree run directory is handed to the launched agent and is
writable by it, so a claim kept there could be edited by the very process whose
work it describes: an agent could change which queue its session is holding,
which PR a restored rework rewrites, or which paths a tech-lead investigation
admits as evidence roots. Restoration accepts this record as truth, so it has to
sit on the orchestrator's side of that boundary — the same reason tech-lead
launch authority is stored here rather than in the worktree (ADR-0031).

Two things follow from that boundary and are easy to get wrong:

* The row key is the run root **lexically normalised, never symlink-resolved**
  (#6999 F11). The run directory sits in the agent-writable worktree, so
  resolving it on every access would let an agent retarget the key with a
  symlink: the lookup would land on a different row, return "no claim", and the
  terminal would be admitted as claimless instead of quarantined. The lexical
  path is the one the orchestrator allocated and the terminal registry recorded.
* EVERY recorded identity field is validated on read, ``started_at`` included.
  Identity comes from the worktree manifest, and ``started_at`` later becomes
  trusted tech-lead evidence chronology, so accepting a rewritten one would
  launder agent-controlled data into orchestrator authority.

The quarantine table shares this database because it shares its trust boundary
and its lifetime, but not its lifecycle: a quarantine outlives the claim it
could not read and is cleared by a human, never by a session outcome.
