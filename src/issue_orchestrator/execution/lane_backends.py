"""The single registry of lane backends.

Three entrypoints need a backend by name — the lane runner, the gate's
policy preflight, and the operator's pool snapshot — and each needs a
*different* thing built from it. A name list beside one if-chain per
consumer is a place to add a backend per consumer and as many chances
to add it to only some: lane-run would accept a backend the preflight
rejects, which is precisely the gate stepping around its own guard
(A1, #7132 review).

So a backend is ONE registry entry carrying every factory. The
dataclass makes an entry missing any factory a TypeError at import,
the selectable names are derived from the registry rather than
declared beside it, and every builder resolves through the same
lookup. Adding a backend is one entry; there is no second place to
forget.

The scheduler adapter is imported lazily inside its factories: the
default path must not pay for importing a backend it will not use.
