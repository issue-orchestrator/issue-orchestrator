"""Tech Lead session flavor, assignment, and launch authority (ADR-0031).

Three tech_lead variants share one launch path: batch PR review (audit the
orchestrator-prepared PR manifest), failure investigation (diagnose one
failed issue), and the periodic health review (walk the board snapshot,
ADR-0031 §4). The :class:`TechLeadAssignment` written at launch tells the
*agent* which variant its session is (all variants run in ``issue-{N}``
terminals).

Trust boundary: the assignment file and the PR manifest live inside the
agent-writable worktree, so completion must never treat them as orchestrator
authority — an agent could rewrite them mid-session. The
:class:`TechLeadLaunchAuthority` record captures the same launch scope
(flavor, focus, manifest PR set, anchor) for persistence in an
orchestrator-owned store outside the worktree; completion reads THAT record
as authority and treats the worktree copies as the agent's reading material
only (tamper evidence when they diverge).
