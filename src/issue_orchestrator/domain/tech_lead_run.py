"""The vocabulary of a tech-lead RUN: its scope, its request, its verdict (#6994).

A tech-lead run is requested by many callers — the reactive failure model, the
periodic/storm health-review trigger, the stuck sweep, the one-shot CLI, and the
repository dashboard — and every one of them has to name the same things: what
SCOPE the work has, who asked, and what the answer was.

Those names are domain vocabulary, not policy, so they live here rather than
beside the coordinator that applies them
(:mod:`..control.tech_lead_run_admission`). Keeping them apart is what lets an
entrypoint, a view model, or a test speak about runs without importing the
admission machinery — and stops the policy owner from being the de-facto home
for every type the feature touches.

The scopes are deliberately asymmetric, because the work is:

* :class:`GlobalHealthReviewScope` and :class:`GlobalBatchReviewScope` — the
  whole board (one walks the issue board, the other the accumulated PR
  manifest). Each is exclusive of every other tech-lead run, and once queued it
  is a barrier later work waits behind.
* :class:`IssueInvestigationScope` — one focus issue. Different issues may run
  concurrently, bounded only by the numeric tech-lead capacity that
  ``worker_budget.tech_lead_slot_availability`` owns.

The two GLOBAL scopes are separate identities rather than one "global" bucket
(#6994 round 1 F2). They audit different evidence and produce different verdicts,
so a health review must not swallow a batch-review request as a duplicate: they
COALESCE within a flavor and SERIALIZE across flavors. Collapsing them would make
one operator's request silently disappear into the other's run.
