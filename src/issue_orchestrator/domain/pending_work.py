"""The typed queued request a launched session is carrying (#6999 A1).

A session that launched from a pending queue *consumed* a request to do so. Until
that session reaches a true terminal work outcome the request is not spent, it is
merely in flight — and if the session dies for a reason that has nothing to do
with the work (an expired provider credential), the request has to go back.

These are the domain value objects for that span. The policy that decides when a
claim is consumed versus returned lives in
:mod:`issue_orchestrator.control.in_flight_work`; nothing here knows about
providers, terminals, or GitHub.
