"""The LOCAL record of a tech-lead run — ADR-0033's visibility half (#6858).

:mod:`.tech_lead_run` names what a run IS (scope, request, admission verdict)
and the shared ledger coordinates who owns it. Neither remembers that a run
happened. That gap is the "invisible / black box" defect ADR-0033 names: a run
executes as a session on a bookkeeping anchor issue, and once the anchor closes
the only surviving trace of what the tech lead saw, decided, and filed is a
GitHub issue on the *client's* board.

ADR-0033 splits those two jobs by owner: coordination is shared (GitHub), the
run record is LOCAL to the engine that won the run. This module is the local
side's vocabulary — one record per run, referencing its subject rather than
being it, and pointing at the artifacts the run left behind. Those artifacts
are the run's OWN output (its terminal recording, its report, its decision),
but the record cannot point into where the run wrote them: that is a worktree
the run does not own — throwaway scratch for a failure investigation (#6823),
an anchor worktree otherwise — and cleanup may remove it the moment the run
ends. So a concluding run has the artifacts it actually produced copied out
into an engine-owned archive, and :class:`.TechLeadRunArtifacts` records where
that copy is and which kinds are in it (#6858 F4).

Why a record rather than "just read the session": a session is a *physical*
attempt at a run. Sessions are dropped from live state when they end, their
worktrees are disposable (#6823), and a run can outlive several ticks of
queueing before one ever starts. The run is the durable thing an operator
asks about ("what did the last health review conclude?"), so it gets its own
identity, its own lifecycle, and its own home.

    an hour later share ``global:health_review``. The identity of a *recorded*
    run is its session run — ``(run_id, session_name)`` — which is also exactly
    what the replay surface needs to find its artifacts.

    ``subject_issue_number`` is a REFERENCE, never ownership, and it belongs to

    review references no issue at all, because its subject is the board. The
