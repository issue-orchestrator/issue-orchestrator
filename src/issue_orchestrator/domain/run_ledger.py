"""The repository-wide ledger of live tech-lead runs, and its matrix (#6994).

A per-key claim cannot express the rule this feature exists to enforce. "Exactly
one engine owns ``issue:42``" is a statement about ONE key; "a whole-repository
review is exclusive of every other tech-lead run" is a statement about the
RELATIONSHIP between keys, and no composition of independent single-key
compare-and-swaps decides it: engine A can win ``global:health_review`` while
engine B independently wins ``issue:42``, and both are correct about their own
key while together violating the invariant (#6994 round 2 F1).

So the shared cell holds the whole picture. One ledger per repository, holding
every live run any engine has queued or running, mutated by compare-and-swap.
Because the ledger is the unit of atomicity, the conflict matrix is evaluated
against ALL of it — which is the only way "any live global conflicts with every
tech-lead run, while distinct issue scopes coexist" can be true across engines.

Two lifecycle states, because the matrix needs both:

* ``QUEUED`` — this run is admitted and waiting. Reserving a queued slot is
  NEVER refused by the barrier: waiting behind a global run is the designed
  behaviour, not a conflict, and refusing here would silently lose the request.
* ``RUNNING`` — a session is executing this run. The barrier applies HERE, at
  promotion, because that is the moment exclusivity actually means something.

Everything in this module is pure: the same :func:`resolve` decides the matrix
for the in-memory single-instance store and for the GitHub ref adapter, so the
two cannot drift, and the whole matrix is unit-testable without a network.
