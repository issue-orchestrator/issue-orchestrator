"""Typed review-exchange manifest sections.

The per-exchange ``manifest.json`` accumulates fields written by
several producers (run start, recording wiring, retention metadata,
artifact registration). Each producer owns a coherent slice of the
schema. This module names those slices as frozen dataclasses with
explicit ``to_manifest_fields`` (writer side) and ``from_manifest``
(reader side) methods so:

- Writers cannot forget a required field — the constructor enforces it.
- Readers can't silently see a missing/wrong-typed field — parsing
  fails loudly via ``from_manifest``.
- The contract is one place: adding a field to a section forces the
  refactor through every call site, instead of one writer drifting
  ahead of one reader (the recurring brittleness pattern that
  produced PR #6267 / #6268 / #6270's review whack-a-mole).

The dataclasses are domain-pure: ``Path`` plus ``str | None``. They
do not reach into the execution layer; the execution-side adapters
own serialization to/from the on-disk JSON.

    exchange. The cache loader and the consecutive-failure counter
