"""Finding-promotion domain vocabulary (#6957).

Pattern case files (#6781) accrue evidence but had no actuation lane: a
diagnosed, reproducible orchestrator bug sat in a case file until a human
hand-carried it into a fix. This module is the domain vocabulary for the lane
that closes that gap — case file -> gated runnable issue in the repo that owns
the fix -> merged fix -> ``tech_lead_shipped_fixes`` row.

Two durable facts drive it, both orchestrator-owned (never issue bodies):

* :class:`PatternEvidence` — one row per pattern signature: its case file, how
  many observations have accrued, and the tech lead's ``fix:code`` /
  ``fix:human`` classification. Only ``fix:code`` is ever promotable — a
  human-gated problem made runnable manufactures doomed rework.
* :class:`PromotedFinding` — one row per PROMOTED signature: which repo it was
  filed in, which issue, and its terminal state. ``declined`` is permanent
  (closing a gated promotion is a rejection, and it must never be re-filed);
  ``shipped`` records the merged fix that closed the loop.

The types are infrastructure-agnostic: no GitHub, no config, no ports.

        Only reachable once the old create is proven ABSENT: the ledger row is
        committed from the intent while the remote issue is created from the
        current action's body and labels, so any metadata those two disagree on
        is persisted wrong. A signature whose area was still unclassified when
        the first attempt died, then upgraded by a later observation that routes
        to the same repo, filed an issue tagged ``area:db`` and recorded
        ``PromotedFinding.area = ""`` — and settlement copies that into the
        shipped-fix row, mis-classifying operational memory (#6957 round-4
        review F10).

        ``body_observations`` is deliberately NOT refreshed. It is the one fact
        this type exists to carry across the crash window: the evidence count
        the filed body documents. Keeping the older value means at worst one
        evidence comment is repeated, which is the direction this fails in on
        purpose — see the module docstring of ``tech_lead_promotion_filing``.
        ``target_repo`` is not refreshed either; a re-pointed route retires the
        intent outright rather than restating it.
