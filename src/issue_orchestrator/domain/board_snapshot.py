"""Board snapshot - typed orchestrator-state facts for triage/tech-lead sessions.

A ``BoardSnapshot`` is a serializable bundle of orchestrator-state facts
(active sessions, pending queues, blocked issues, recent failures, timeline
extracts, log tail) written to a file that a triage or tech-lead agent
session reads to understand the state of the board.

Flow:
1. Orchestrator: ``BoardSnapshotBuilder.build()`` -> ``BoardSnapshot``
2. Orchestrator: ``snapshot.write(path)`` into the session worktree
3. Agent: reads the snapshot file, reasons about the board, reports via
   ``coding-done``

The snapshot is a point-in-time fact bundle, not live state: it carries a
``generated_at`` timestamp and a ``schema_version`` so readers can reject
payloads they do not understand. ``from_dict`` fails fast on an unexpected
schema version or missing required keys - a malformed snapshot must never
be silently reinterpreted.

# on each active session so the review can tell the two apart before proposing
# the GATED ``kill_hung_session`` (never an auto-execute).

# Sentinel for an unknown idle reading (the terminal recording's mtime could

# The health review's board snapshot carries an AGGREGATE view of E2E suite
# health (ADR-0031). E2E is easy to neglect — it runs on a slow ungoverned
# cadence and rots unwatched — so these facts make cadence, red streaks, and
# chronic failures first-class on the review's primary input.

# How many of the most-recent runs the snapshot carries as "chronically red"
# evidence, and the window over which ``nonpassing_streak`` is measured (the

# least this many", look at ``recent_runs``).

      how ``E2ERunHealthFact.started_at`` becomes ``age_minutes``), so a high
      idle with no commit progress is a hang signal.
    - ``commits_ahead``: commits on the session's branch ahead of base. A real
      ``0`` after a long idle is strong hang evidence; recent commits mean it is
      working. ``COMMITS_AHEAD_UNKNOWN`` (-1) when the working copy could not be
      read (e.g. the worktree is gone).

    A reader that can read neither signal may return ``None`` instead of this
