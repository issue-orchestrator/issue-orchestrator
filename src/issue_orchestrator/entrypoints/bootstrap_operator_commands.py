"""Compose the operator retry/dismiss commands (#6999 F5/A2).

Assembled here, at the composition root, because the command's collaborators are
exactly the container's: the label owner, the label registry, the fresh issue
reader, the queue-cache store. Only the live state and the lock guarding it come
from the facade, and those arrive through the factory call.

The point of routing both endpoints through one composed command is that the
transport can no longer reach past it: there is nowhere for the HTTP layer to
learn the retry-history representation or the queue cache from, so the
"labels first, local state only if that committed" ordering has one home.
