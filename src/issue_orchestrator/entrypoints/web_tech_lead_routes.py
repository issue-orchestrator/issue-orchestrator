"""Dashboard tech-lead run command surface (#6994).

One authenticated command endpoint with a discriminated scope. The route does
exactly three things: parse the generated request model, hand ONE typed command
to the run-admission owner, and map its typed outcome onto the response. It
never inspects the pending queue, never mutates a state collection, and never
launches a session — those are the coordinator's and the planner's jobs, and
keeping them there is what stops a second copy of the admission policy growing
inside a web handler.

It also never shells out to ``orchestrator health-review``: that one-shot
command builds its OWN in-process orchestrator, takes the repository lock, and
pauses planning, so it cannot coexist with the engine this dashboard is serving.
