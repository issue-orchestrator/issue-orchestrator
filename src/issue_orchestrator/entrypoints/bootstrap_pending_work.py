"""Composition of the pending-work ledger and everything that reads it (#6999).

Three collaborators that only make sense together: the orchestrator-owned claim
ledger, the quarantine owner that escalates rows it cannot read, and the
shared-``needs-human``-block reader both that owner and the tech-lead lifecycle
consult before touching the label they share.

They are assembled here rather than at each composition root because the wiring
is a correctness contract, not a convenience: the block reader must be given the
SAME claim store the quarantine owner writes to, or it reports "no quarantine
holds this issue" about the very rows that do (#6999 F4). Two roots assembling
that by hand is two chances to get it wrong.
