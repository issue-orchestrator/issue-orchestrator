"""Composition of the provider resilience/readiness collaborators (#6999).

Four objects that only make sense together: the circuit store, the circuit
owner that writes it, the credential probe, and the per-tick sampler that turns
those two into the single launch-eligibility fact planning reads. Assembled
here, in the composition-root package, so control code never has to know how
they fit together — and so the main bootstrap module stays about the shape of
the orchestrator rather than about this one subsystem.
