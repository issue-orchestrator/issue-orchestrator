"""What the engine must publish before any agent session can launch.

An agent subprocess can only call back if two things are true at the
moment it starts:

1. it holds a credential the serving surface accepts, and
2. it was told a port something is actually listening on.

Both are established during engine startup, by different code paths,
and neither is visible in a session's own wiring. When one silently did
not happen, every agent callback failed and the round runner read the
resulting silence as an unresponsive agent — SIGKILLing healthy coders
and stranding validated work (#6913, #6924).

This is the public seam that owns both, so production and tests drive
the same object. ``run_orchestrator`` holds one and calls it; a test
that wants to prove "the real engine publishes auth and an endpoint
before sessions can launch" drives this rather than reassembling
startup from private helpers — reassembly is precisely what hid the
missing wiring.

        Security #5987 F3 — PR 8. The same admin token is shared with the

        the loaded ``Config`` instance; its ``browser_session_ttl_seconds``

        the built-in defaults while the Control API honored the config —
        the same rule enforced differently by path.
