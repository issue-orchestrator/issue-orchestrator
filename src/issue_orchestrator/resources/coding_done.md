# CRITICAL: You MUST call coding-done before exiting

There is NO other way to complete this session. If you exit without calling `coding-done`, your work is LOST and the session will time out, requiring human intervention.

Read the task-specific prompt file for what to do. Return here for how to signal completion.

---

## IMPORTANT: Clean Working Tree Required

Before calling `coding-done`, your working tree must be clean.

1. Run `git status --short`.
2. Classify each dirty file before staging anything. For each one:
   1. **Part of the work you are pushing** → stage that path explicitly by name and commit it. Do not stash work that belongs in this push — stashing leaves HEAD on the commit you are about to replace, and the stashed change never reaches the push.
   2. **A disposable artifact you created yourself** → delete it, or add its path to `.gitignore`. Only take this path when you created the file during this session and can positively identify it as disposable, such as build output or a generated artifact you produced.
   3. **Anything else** — pre-existing edits, files you did not create, anything you cannot positively classify → preserve it and clear the guard without touching its contents. Never delete or revert a file you did not create. It may be operator or user work that cannot be recovered. An untracked path can be added to `.gitignore`, which clears the guard and leaves the file on disk untouched — that edit makes `.gitignore` itself dirty, and it belongs in your commit. If it cannot be cleared that way, stop and report `coding-done blocked --reason "cannot classify dirty file <path>" --attempted "inspected the file and its history"` rather than destroying it.
3. Stage the paths you classified under rung 1 explicitly by name. Never stage every changed file at once.
4. Run `prepush-check --dirty-only -v`; it must pass before `coding-done`. That check is the gate for *completing*; if you reached rung 3 and are escalating instead, go straight to the escalation command — it accepts the dirty tree on purpose.
5. `coding-done` will **reject a dirty working tree** and exit non-zero.

Generated sources, lock files, and schemas that *your* change produced are rung 1 — they belong in the same commit as the change that caused them.

Runtime-managed metadata under `.issue-orchestrator/` and `.claude/` is ignored by the orchestrator dirty guard.

If you cannot resolve a file under any rung, explain why in the `--problems` field.

## IMPORTANT: Commit First, THEN Run the Publish Gate

The publish validation suite is cached by **HEAD commit SHA**. A green result is
reused by the git pre-push hook that actually publishes your branch — and by any
later re-run of the gate itself — but only if it was recorded at the *exact
commit that gets pushed*.

So the order is:

1. Iterate with the fast/quick validation command while you work.
2. **Commit** once you believe the change is done.
3. **Then** run the full publish gate: `prepush-check -v` (or this repo's
   cache-aware wrapper around it, if it has one).
4. If it fails: fix, **commit again**, and re-run `prepush-check -v`.

Running the publish gate before committing is wasted work, twice over:

- The dirty-tree guard runs **first**, so on an uncommitted tree the gate exits
  non-zero without validating anything at all.
- If you commit after a green run, the result is recorded against the *parent*
  commit. Every later consumer misses the cache and re-runs the whole suite,
  which on a large repo can exceed the session's time budget and strand your
  work.

**Do not `git stash` work that belongs in this push.** Stashing leaves HEAD on
the parent commit, so the gate records a result for a SHA you are about to
invalidate — and the stashed change never reaches the push at all. Commit it
instead.

Files that do *not* belong in this branch are a different case: resolve them
under the rungs above. Never commit a file just to clear the dirty guard — in
`all` mode the guard reports every untracked path, and committing them blindly
is how detritus and secrets reach a branch — and never destroy one either,
because unrelated does not mean disposable.

## IMPORTANT: Do Not Skip Tests

Do not disable, skip, quarantine, or weaken failing tests to make validation pass.
For JUnit/Kotlin/Java this includes `assumeTrue`, `assumeFalse`, `@Disabled`, and `@Ignore`.
Fix the code, improve the fixture, or report blocked with the specific reason.

## Completion Protocol

When your work is done (or you cannot proceed), call `coding-done` with the appropriate status:

**Completed successfully:**
```bash
coding-done completed \
  --implementation "What you did" \
  --problems "Any issues encountered, or 'None'"
```

**Completed one slice of an issue that needs several PRs:**

Some issues say their acceptance spans several PRs (for example "one PR per
package; this issue closes when the last one lands"). If your PR delivers only
part of the issue and more PRs must follow, add `--partial`:
```bash
coding-done completed \
  --implementation "What this slice did, and what remains" \
  --problems "Any issues encountered, or 'None'" \
  --partial
```
The PR body then says `Refs #N` instead of `Closes #N`, so merging it leaves the
issue open and the orchestrator schedules the next slice. Leave `--partial` off
the PR that finishes the issue. Do not use it to avoid finishing work you were
asked to do. The reference line is set when the PR is first opened; rework on
an existing PR keeps it.

If you discovered unrelated ancillary work while staying focused on the assigned issue, write those proposals to a JSON or JSONL file first, then add `--follow-up-file path` to the completed command above.
Each entry should include `title` and `reason`, and may include `evidence`, `suggested_labels`, and `blocking`.

**Cannot proceed - external blocker:**
```bash
coding-done blocked \
  --reason "Why you're blocked" \
  --attempted "What you tried" \
  --blocked-by 123 456 \
  --when-unblocked "Hint for resolution"
```
The `--blocked-by` and `--when-unblocked` options are optional.

**Cannot proceed - gave up:**
```bash
coding-done blocked \
  --reason "Could not complete: <why>" \
  --attempted "Tried X, Y, Z - none worked"
```

**Need human decision:**
```bash
coding-done needs_human \
  --question "What do you need answered?" \
  --context "Background info" \
  --options "Option A" "Option B" \
  --default "What to do if no response"
```
The `--context`, `--options`, and `--default` options are optional.

### Additional options

All statuses support:
- `--pr-labels label1 label2` - Extra labels to add to the PR
- `--dry-run` - Show what would be written without writing
- `--verbose` - Show detailed output

Completed status also supports:
- `--follow-up-file path` - Structured proposals for ancillary follow-up issues discovered during the work
- `--partial` - This PR delivers part of the issue; it references the issue instead of closing it

## What happens after coding-done

1. **Dirty-file check** - coding-done verifies your working tree is clean
2. **Quick validation runs** (if configured) - fast tests, linting, type checks
3. **If validation fails**: coding-done exits non-zero. Fix the issues and run coding-done again.
4. **Preflight push check** - verifies the push will succeed
5. **If all checks pass**: Completion record is written
6. **Orchestrator takes over**: runs publish validation, pushes code, creates PR, posts comments, updates labels

You do NOT push code or touch GitHub directly. The orchestrator handles all external operations.

## If validation keeps failing

If you genuinely cannot fix the validation errors after multiple attempts:

```bash
coding-done blocked \
  --reason "Validation failing: <specific error>" \
  --attempted "Tried to fix by X, Y, Z"
```

This signals you need help without pretending the work is complete.
