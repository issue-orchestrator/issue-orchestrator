"""Port for executing one persistent-session review exchange.

The review-exchange runner owns the full lifecycle of one coder↔reviewer
exchange: it creates the sibling reviewer worktree, drives the round
loop against the persistent agent sessions, fast-forwards the reviewer
between rounds, and reclaims the worktree on exit (success or failure).

Hiding the runner behind a port lets ``control/`` depend on a behavior
contract instead of reaching across the layer boundary into
``execution/``. The previous cutover used ``importlib.import_module``
to keep the import-linter contracts honest at the static-graph layer
(see #6161); injecting this port makes the indirection unnecessary.
