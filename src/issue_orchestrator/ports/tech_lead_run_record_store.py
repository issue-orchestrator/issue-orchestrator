"""Port for the LOCAL tech-lead run-record store (ADR-0033 / #6858).

The sibling of :mod:`.run_ledger_store`, and its opposite in every dimension
that matters. The ledger is SHARED (GitHub-backed), holds only what a peer
engine must know — "claimed by X until T" — and is consulted to make decisions.
This store is LOCAL, holds everything an *operator* wants ("what did the last
health review conclude, and where is its transcript?"), and is never consulted
to decide anything. Keeping them as two ports is what stops the run record
drifting back onto the client's board: nothing here can be read by a peer, so
nothing here can be load-bearing for coordination.

Exception contract, mirroring the ledger's: implementations MUST NOT raise for
an unreachable backing store. Visibility bookkeeping failing is never a reason
to fail a tech-lead run — the run is the product, the record is the receipt —
so writes are best-effort and reads degrade to "no history", both loudly logged
by the implementation rather than silently swallowed by callers.
