"""Typed provider-readiness / auth-failure boundary (#6999).

One concept — "is this provider authenticated, and is this output an auth
failure" — with exactly one owner. Provider *execution* adapters do all the raw
interpretation (running the CLI's auth probe, reading its TUI banner); control
consumes only the typed :class:`ProviderReadiness` value defined here.

Why this exists: on 2026-08-04 an expired Claude Code login produced four
back-to-back 90-minute zero-work sessions. Every layer that could have caught it
had a partial seam — ``CLIProvider.is_authenticated()`` with no call site, an
auth classification table that only knew HTTP tokens — and the naive fix would
have grown a *third* independent "is this an auth failure" site in the session
watcher. This port is the single typed outcome all three consumers share:

* the launch gate (park instead of spawning a doomed session),
* the live-session observer (fail in minutes with a non-timeout outcome),
* :class:`~issue_orchestrator.control.provider_resilience.ProviderResilienceManager`
  (still the sole circuit-state owner; it consumes typed AUTH outcomes).
