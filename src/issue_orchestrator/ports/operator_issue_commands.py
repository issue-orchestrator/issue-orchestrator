"""Port: what an operator's "retry" and "dismiss" buttons actually do (#6999 F5).

These two commands are not label edits with some bookkeeping after them. Each is
ONE transition across two stores that must agree: the labels GitHub carries, and
the in-memory retry/queue/history state the planner reads. The invariant joining
them has a direction - *local state may only be pruned once the GitHub side of
the transition committed* - because pruning first hides an issue GitHub still
blocks and lets the planner relaunch straight into it.

That invariant needs one implementation. It previously had none: the HTTP layer
constructed the label owner, branched on its fields, then reset retry history,
replaced session history, rewrote cached issue state and rebuilt a queue cache
itself - so the ordering rule lived in the transport, once per endpoint, and
drifted between them.

So the transport asks for a COMMAND and maps ONE typed outcome. It does not know
the label owner, the retry-history representation, the queue cache, or the order
they must be touched in.

The outcome lives HERE rather than in the control implementation (#6999 F6): a
port whose return type is owned by one concrete implementation is not a contract
anybody can depend on, it is that implementation wearing a Protocol. And the
outcome carries FACTS - what happened, to which labels, held by whom - never a
response body. How those facts are phrased and shaped is transport policy, and
lives at the transport edge.
