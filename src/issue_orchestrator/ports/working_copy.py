"""Working copy port for local VCS operations.

This module defines the protocol (interface) for local working copy operations.
Unlike PRRepository (which handles remote GitHub operations), this handles
local worktree/working copy operations: push, rebase, commit info, etc.

Naming convention (from architecture review):
- "WorkingCopy" conveys local filesystem + branch + HEAD
- No implication of authority (just execution)
- Common in SCM theory

Separation of concerns:
- WorkingCopy: Local VCS operations (in worktree context) - EXECUTION
- RepoHost (PRRepository, etc.): Remote platform operations - EXECUTION
- LifecycleController: State transitions and decisions - AUTHORITY
