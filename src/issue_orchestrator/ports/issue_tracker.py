"""Issue tracker port for accessing issue data.

This module defines the protocol (interface) for issue tracking operations.
Implementations of this protocol can use different platforms (GitHub, GitLab,
Jira, etc.) while maintaining the same interface.

Naming: "Tracker" implies external system CRUD operations, not internal storage.
This is an execution-layer interface.
