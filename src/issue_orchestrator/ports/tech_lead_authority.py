"""Port for orchestrator-owned tech_lead launch authority (ADR-0031).

The agent-writable worktree carries copies of the tech_lead assignment and PR
manifest for the *agent* to read; the orchestrator must never treat those
copies as authority (#6761 re-review F1). This port is the behavior seam the
control plane uses instead: it owns trusted launch scope plus the durable
proposal, pattern, and shipped-fix ledgers that tech_lead policy consults across
process restarts.

Constructed once at the composition root (``entrypoints/bootstrap.py``) and
injected into the session launcher, the completion processor, and the
completion action planner. Tests mock this protocol; the durable SQLite
implementation lives in ``infra/tech_lead_authority_store.py``.
