"""The durable ledger of queued work that has left its queue (#6999 F4/F7/F8).

A request removed from a pending queue at launch exists nowhere else until the
session that took it reaches a terminal outcome. The pending queues themselves
are in-memory, so this store — not those lists — is the authoritative record.
Three durable states cover that whole span:

* **held** — a live run is doing this work.
* **deferred** — the run stopped for a provider reason; the work is untouched
  and waiting to be relaunched.
* **gone** — the row is deleted, and only a true terminal work outcome does that.

Why deferral is a state rather than a delete (#6999 F8): re-admitting the
request to an in-memory queue is not durable, so deleting the row at that moment
opens a window where a crash loses the only record. The row survives the
transition and startup re-admits from it; the relaunch that takes the work again
supersedes it by :meth:`PendingWorkClaim.work_key`.

Why implementations must not store any of this in the run directory (#6999 F7):
that directory lives inside the session worktree, which is handed to the
launched agent and is writable by it. A claim stored there would let an agent
rewrite what work the orchestrator believes it is doing — which queue, on which
PR, with which evidence hints — and restoration would accept it as truth. That
inverts "Agent Intent, Orchestrator Authority".

Rows are addressed by the ORCHESTRATOR-allocated run root and validated against
every field of the run identity recorded with them. Run ids are timestamps and
are not unique on their own; identities come from the worktree manifest and are
agent-writable. So neither is a safe address by itself, and a mismatch on any
recorded field fails closed rather than reading as "no claim".
