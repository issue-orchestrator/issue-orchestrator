"""Projection of tech-lead run state into the dashboard's action affordances (#6994).

Presentation only. Which runs exist, at what scope, and whether one blocks
another is decided by the run-admission owner
(:mod:`..control.tech_lead_run_admission`); this module only turns that into the
flags and the NON-COLOUR status text the two dashboard actions render.

The affordance is deliberately advisory: a disabled button is a courtesy, never
authority. Every click still goes to ``POST /api/tech-lead/runs``, which
re-decides admission against live state — so a stale view model can at worst
show a stale label, never admit a run it should not have.
