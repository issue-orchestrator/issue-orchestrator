Pure control policy over explicit arguments — no dependency bundle, no
infra — so these rules can be read and tested without standing up a
launcher, and so every launch flavor applies the same ones.

They live together because they share a contract: return a
``LaunchResult`` describing the refusal, or ``None`` to proceed.
