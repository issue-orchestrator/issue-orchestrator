"""Action dataclasses - the Plan/Apply boundary.

Actions are the output of planning logic and the input to the applier.
They describe WHAT should happen, not HOW.

This separation enables:
- Planning code to be tested without IO (pure logic)
- Applier to be tested with fake ports
- Clear audit trail of decisions

Usage:
    # In workflow/planner
    actions = [
        AddLabelAction(issue_number=123, label="in-progress"),
        LaunchSessionAction(session_type=SessionType.ISSUE, number=123, ...),

    # In applier
    for action in actions:
        result = applier.apply(action)
