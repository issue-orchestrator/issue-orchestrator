"""The optimistic-concurrency gate every mutation crosses (#6957 round-2 F4/A5).

``ActionApplier`` owns a lot; this is the one part of it that decides whether a
write may happen AT ALL, so it gets to be its own named owner rather than two
methods buried in a 1800-line dispatcher. Two rules, and they are the whole
module:

1. **Unknown is not empty.** The reader raises when it cannot read an issue
   (:class:`~..ports.fresh_issue_reader.FreshIssueReadError`), and this turns
   that into "unknown", never into an observed empty label set. The distinction
   is load-bearing: an empty set SATISFIES an expectation that merely forbids
   ``io:needs-reconcile``, so conflating them let a failed GitHub read walk the
   control plane straight through an operator pause.
2. **Unknown fails closed.** An action carrying expectations that cannot be
   verified raises ``ReconciliationRequired`` — the same outcome as a verified
   violation — so the orchestrator pauses the issue instead of guessing.

Actions with no ``ExpectedState``, and appliers with reconciliation disabled,
pass straight through; that is the pre-existing contract and this module does
not change it.
