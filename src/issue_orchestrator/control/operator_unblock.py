"""What an operator's "retry" or "dismiss" actually does to an issue (#6999 A2).

Both commands mean the same thing to the board: take the labels that are
holding this issue back off, and only then let the orchestrator treat it as
free again. The endpoints used to spell that out themselves - a loop of raw
label writes, one typed owner call in the middle, and local-state pruning
afterwards - which is how the two drifted apart. Retry learned to respect a
refusal from the shared-block owner; dismiss caught the same refusal, threw it
away, pruned its state and told the operator the issue was dismissed.

So the sequence is one owner command with a typed outcome, and both endpoints
consume it. Two rules live here rather than in either endpoint:

* the SHARED BLOCK goes first, because it is the one label whose owner can
  legitimately refuse. A refusal means a quarantine or a tech-lead escalation
  still requires it, and both re-assert it within a tick - so an operator who
  is told "dismissed" would watch it come straight back;
* a refusal stops the rest. In particular it must not go on to strip the
  tech-lead marker, which is frequently the very provenance the refusal was
  protecting: removing it would leave the shared label standing with nothing
  left to explain or recover it.

Ordinary labels are attempted individually and each failure is REPORTED rather
than swallowed. This owner does not decide what a failure means - its caller
does, from the outcome - but it must not make one invisible: a removal that
raises here has already been through the repository adapter's own idempotence
(a 404 is success) and its own transport retries, so it is a label GitHub still
carries (#6999 F5 round 7).
