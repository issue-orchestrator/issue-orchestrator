    """Launch a queued tech_lead session and update orchestrator queues.

    The pending-tech-lead queue carries every tech_lead variant — threshold-created
    batch tracking issues, interval-created health-review anchors (ADR-0031
    §4), and failure investigations — and the planner launches them
    through this path before ordinary issue pickup. The producer boundary that
    queued the item declared its flavor; forward it verbatim (#6768 B5:
    hard-coding one flavor here made batch reviews skip manifest prep).

    Queue lifecycle mirrors :func:`orchestrator_launch_review_session`
    (#6768 round 4 — a launched item previously stayed queued and was
    relaunched every tick): the item is removed through the owning
    :class:`PendingSessionQueues` on success, on restore of an existing
    terminal, and on permanent launch failure (labels-as-truth recovers a
    dropped batch at startup; a dropped investigation is a best-effort audit).
    It is retained in exactly three cases:

    - ``EXISTING_TERMINAL`` — a terminal that could not be restored yet;
    - ``PROVIDER_DEFERRED`` — the provider refused before anything was
      attempted. Nothing about the investigation failed, so it keeps its full
      retry budget and simply waits for a tick when the provider is ready
      (#6999 F10);
    - ``RETRYABLE_FAILURE`` — the launch attempt failed transiently BEFORE the
      session started: required-input prep, or a terminal that never came up.
      For failure investigations the queued item is the only record of the
      investigation (no labels-as-truth recovery), so one transient
      SQLite/log/filesystem/terminal error must not delete it. Retention is
      bounded by the queue owner (``plan_tech_lead_retry``); on exhaustion
      the item is dropped as a DURABLE needs-human transition — the
      needs-human label plus an explanatory comment applied through the
      launcher's owning action boundary, then the ``ISSUE_NEEDS_HUMAN``
      event (#6771 round 3: a log line and an event alone do not survive an
      orchestrator restart; labels are the source of truth).

    Every one of those outcomes settles the DURABLE claim too, in the same
    transaction (#6999 F4), and the ledger hears first (#6999 F2). A retained
    item keeps its deferred row, rewritten with the retry budget the retention
    just spent BEFORE that spend reaches the queue; a dropped one - permanent
    failure, or a committed escalation after exhaustion - has its row retired
    before the queue item goes, so the startup sweep cannot re-admit an
    investigation the bound already ended.
