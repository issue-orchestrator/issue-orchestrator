"""What a provider outage means for the session it stopped (#6999 F5/F2).

Extracted from :mod:`completion_action_planner`: a provider-caused block is a
different KIND of completion from an agent-reported one - it says nothing about
the issue's substance - and it needs its own collaborators (the availability
policy that owns the circuit assessment, plus the label vocabulary). Keeping it
beside the twelve other completion-status branches buried that distinction and
pushed the planner past its line budget.

    """Actions for a session blocked by its provider, not by its work.

    The provider-blocked label and the durable issue-scoped record are two
    halves of one transition, and ``ApplyProviderImpactAction`` is the only
    thing that keeps them together (#5980 F1). Generic blocked handling would
    apply a bare ``AddLabelAction``, after which the impact planner sees the
    label already present and has no transition left to record - the outage
    would vanish from the issue's history (#6999 F5).

    Unlike the generic path this rule does NOT differ by session kind: a review
    or rework session stalled by a dead credential impacts its issue exactly as
    a coding session does, so every kind gets the transition. The claim release
    stays kind-scoped, because holding the issue is a property of the coding
    session, not of the outage.

    No comment is posted. The impact command emits an issue-scoped
    ``provider.issue_blocked`` event that survives the label being shed, which
    is precisely the durable signal #5980 added to replace commenting on every
    affected issue during a fleet-wide outage.

    A rework session additionally gets its ``needs-rework`` trigger back. The
    in-memory queue restore is owned by ``InFlightWorkLedger`` (#6999 F2), but
    the label is the crash-safe half of the same fact: the launcher strips it
    when the session starts, so leaving it off would mean an orchestrator
    restarted during the outage sees a PR that asked for rework and no longer
    says so.
