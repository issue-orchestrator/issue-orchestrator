"""ActionApplier - executes actions via ports/adapters.

This is the IO boundary for the orchestrator. It:
1. Takes Action objects (the plan)
2. Executes them via injected ports
3. Emits trace events for each action
4. Returns ActionResults

When reconciliation is enabled (reconcile=True with fresh_issue_reader provided):
- Before any label mutation, fetches current labels
- Verifies current state is as expected
- Aborts with ReconciliationRequired if mismatch
- Only proceeds with mutation if state matches

Usage:
    applier = ActionApplier(
        labels=label_set,
        sessions=session_manager,
        events=event_sink,
        repository_host=github_adapter,  # For issue creation, label sync
        worktree_manager=git_worktree_manager,  # For worktree removal
        fresh_issue_reader=github_fresh_reader,  # Optional, for reconciliation
        reconcile=True,  # Enable reconciliation
    )
    results = applier.apply_all(actions)
