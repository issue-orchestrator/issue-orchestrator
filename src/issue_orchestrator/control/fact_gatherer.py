"""FactGatherer - creates immutable snapshots for planning.

This module extracts fact-gathering logic from the orchestrator,
making it a pure read-only component that:
1. Reads current state (OrchestratorState)
2. Fetches external data via ports (RepositoryHost)
3. Returns immutable facts for the Planner

The FactGatherer makes NO decisions and plans no mutations - all state
transitions happen in the orchestrator based on Plan execution. Its only
outputs besides the snapshot are fire-and-forget observation sinks: trace
events (EventSink) and the tech_lead board projection (TechLeadBoardPublisher,
#6781), both projections of what was observed, never policy.

Usage:
    gatherer = FactGatherer(
        config=config,
        repository_host=github_adapter,
    )
    snapshot = gatherer.create_snapshot(state, issues)

        rather than optional so this can never silently report an EMPTY approval
        backlog because a caller forgot to hand over its observation (#7014).

        Four independent triggers can each produce facts (only the case where
        none is active yields None):
          * BATCH fields, gated by ``tech_lead_review_threshold`` (via the watch
            label);
          * HEALTH-REVIEW fields, gated by
            ``tech_lead.health_review.interval_minutes`` when the periodic review
            is due, and independently by :func:`storm_possible` so an
            unscheduled storm escalation can dedup its anchor on a tick the
            interval is not due (including ``interval_minutes=0``, which
            disables only the periodic trigger);
          * PROPOSAL fields (approved-op execution + terminal-op cleanup
            candidates), armed by the tech lead agent's local op ledger and
            reconciled whenever it holds an op — INDEPENDENT of the batch
            review threshold (#6779 R12), so a manual-approval / default
            (threshold=0) proposal still advances and self-heals.
          * APPROVAL-BACKLOG fields, armed by observing a gate-labeled open
            issue on the board (#7014). This one costs no read at all — the
            board is already in hand — and it arms independently so a repo
            whose only tech-lead activity is a pile of gated proposals still
            publishes an operator board that shows them.

        GitHub API discipline shapes every read here: due-ness and storm
        possibility are pure state/config math computed FIRST, so a health-only
        configuration that is neither due nor holding enough problems to storm
        makes ZERO GitHub calls (no anchor fact can affect planning until one
        of the two can fire); the exhaustive tech-lead-agent scan runs only when
        the batch trigger is armed OR the local op ledger has proposals to
        reconcile (an empty ledger has nothing to approve or clean up, so no
        scan is worth making). A due health review also uses that exhaustive scan
        so its snapshot includes open case files while still deduplicating its
        anchor, and a possible storm uses it for that same dedup on a tick the
        interval is not due. Observation only: milestone ASSEMBLY policy
        (strategy choice, explicit name -> number resolution) belongs to
        planning and the create-issue applier boundary (#6769 round 3) — no
