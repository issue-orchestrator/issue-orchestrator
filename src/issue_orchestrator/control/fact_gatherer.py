"""FactGatherer - creates immutable snapshots for planning.

This module extracts fact-gathering logic from the orchestrator,
making it a pure read-only component that:
1. Reads current state (OrchestratorState)
2. Fetches external data via ports (RepositoryHost)
3. Returns immutable facts for the Planner

The FactGatherer makes NO decisions and plans no mutations - all state
transitions happen in the orchestrator based on Plan execution. Its only
outputs besides the snapshot are fire-and-forget observation sinks: trace
events (EventSink) and the triage board projection (TriageBoardPublisher,
#6781), both projections of what was observed, never policy.

Usage:
    gatherer = FactGatherer(
        config=config,
        repository_host=github_adapter,
    )
    snapshot = gatherer.create_snapshot(state, issues)

            ``triage.health_review.interval_minutes`` when the periodic review
            is due, and independently by :func:`storm_possible` so an
            unscheduled storm escalation can dedup its anchor on a tick the
            interval is not due (including ``interval_minutes=0``, which
            disables only the periodic trigger);

        possibility are pure state/config math computed FIRST, so a health-only
        configuration that is neither due nor holding enough problems to storm

        of the two can fire); the exhaustive triage-agent scan runs only when
        the batch trigger is armed OR the local op ledger has proposals to
        reconcile (an empty ledger has nothing to approve or clean up, so no
        scan is worth making). A due health review also uses that exhaustive scan
        so its snapshot includes open case files while still deduplicating its
        anchor, and a possible storm uses it for that same dedup on a tick the
        interval is not due. Observation only: milestone ASSEMBLY policy
        (strategy choice, explicit name -> number resolution) belongs to
        planning and the create-issue applier boundary (#6769 round 3) — no
        milestone API reads happen here.

    Owner of the single lifecycle rule for "triage problem artifacts currently
    referenced by pending or active triage work". A failed session records its
    ``ImmediateCleanup`` in the same pass that records the
    ``DiscoveredFailure``, but the triage work that reads those artifacts
    launches on a LATER tick — removing the worktree first deletes every
    artifact hint the work was queued to read (#6771 round 3). The rule is
    evaluated fresh from state at both consuming seams (``gather_cleanup_facts``
    so the Planner skips held cleanups, and ``clear_discovered_facts`` so held
    entries survive the end-of-tick fact clear).

    A problem's artifacts are referenced while ANY of these hold:

    - it was discovered this tick (triage-on-failure will queue it);
    - a queued failure investigation targets it;
    - a queued health review carries it in its ``problem_cohort`` — a storm
      collapses the per-issue investigations into ONE anchor, so after that
      collapse the cohort is the only thing still naming those artifacts
      (#6780: holding only failure investigations let the collapsed
      members' worktrees be cleaned up before the review could read them);
    - an active triage session is investigating it; or
    - an active health review OWNS it via the durable storm-cohort ledger.
      A launched review's queue item is gone, so the ledger is what proves
      its run still references the members' artifacts.

    Ledger rows are intersected with anchors that are actually pending or
    active, which is what keeps this owner's release semantics intact: the
    hold releases by re-evaluation, with no dedicated release seam. Once the
    triage work completes — or is dropped on exhaustion, or its queue action
    fails — nothing matches and the retained cleanup is planned normally on
    the next tick, even if a row outlived its anchor.

    worktree forever once the hold releases. Both seams read the SAME owner
    (:func:`triage_problem_artifact_hold_issue_numbers`), so the plan-time
    skip and the end-of-tick retention can never disagree about which

    A PAUSED tick retains every fact. The clear exists to drop facts the tick
    consumed, but a paused tick consumes none: the Planner returns an empty
    plan and ``apply_plan`` refuses to apply actions while paused. Clearing
    would silently discard problems that nothing recorded — a session that
    fails while paused is discovered exactly once, so a dropped storm cohort
    could never be recovered, even after resume.

    ``tick_paused`` MUST be the tick's own ``snapshot.paused`` — the same read
    the Planner decided from — and never a fresh read of live ``state.paused``.
    The two differ: ``state.paused`` is mutated from the web thread, and this
    call is separated from the snapshot by a network fetch, planning and apply.
    Re-reading it would decide retention from one tick's plan and another
    tick's pause state, in both directions: an operator resuming mid-tick would
    wipe facts the empty plan never consumed, and one pausing mid-apply would
    retain facts a partially-applied plan already collapsed into an anchor —
    re-queuing every cohort member individually on resume while the anchor
