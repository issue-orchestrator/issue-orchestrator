"""OrchestratorDeps - All dependencies required by the Orchestrator.

This module defines a frozen dataclass containing all required collaborators
for the Orchestrator. No Optional fields, no Null defaults - the Orchestrator
must be constructed in a fully-wired, valid state.

Principle: "No Nulls in Orchestrator"
- Bootstrap is the single source of truth for choosing implementations
- Tests explicitly pass fakes/nulls (never via defaults)
- Makes wiring readable and type-safe

class OrchestratorDeps:
    """All dependencies required by the Orchestrator.

    This is a frozen (immutable) container for all collaborators.
    No Optional fields - all must be provided at construction time.

    The Orchestrator receives this bundle instead of many individual parameters,
    making the wiring explicit and type-checked.

    Cross-cutting infrastructure services (label management, persistence,
    provider resilience, timeline) are bundled in ``services: InfraServices``.
    Backward-compat properties delegate to the bundle so existing callers
    (e.g. ``deps.provider_resilience``) continue to work unchanged.
