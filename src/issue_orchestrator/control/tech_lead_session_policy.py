"""ADR-0031 owner boundary for tech_lead session identity and completion effects.

Both tech_lead variants (batch PR review and failure investigation) launch as
``issue-{N}`` sessions under the configured tech lead agent, so nothing about a
session's name distinguishes them. This module is the single owner for:

- **identity**: what makes a session a tech_lead session (the config-declared
  tech lead agent), consolidating the checks previously duplicated in
  ``SessionLauncher`` and ``CompletionActionPlanner``;
- **flavor**: reading the launch-time :class:`TechLeadAssignment` that says
  which variant a session was given (manifest selection keys off it);
- **launch preparation**: per-flavor session inputs (PR manifest download,
  the agent-visible assignment copy) plus the orchestrator-owned
  :class:`TechLeadLaunchAuthority` record that completion later trusts
  (#6761 re-review F1);
- **completion effects**: shaping the requested actions a tech_lead completion
  may execute and classifying the benign "clean audit, nothing to publish"
  outcome so it is treated as success rather than a publish failure.
