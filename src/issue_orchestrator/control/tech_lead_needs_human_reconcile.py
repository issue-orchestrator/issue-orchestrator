"""Label-owned needs-human lifecycle for tech_lead launch exhaustion.

The provenance marker and the needs-human label live together on GitHub, the

needed: every unpaused tick discovers marker-owned state, recovers interrupted
escalations, and idempotently removes an escalation that active work has
superseded.
