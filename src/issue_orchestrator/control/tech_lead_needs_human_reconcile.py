        The marker commits first.  Therefore a needs-human label created by this

        marker-only crash is recovered by :meth:`reconcile`, independently of
        the in-memory tech_lead queue.  A bare needs-human label that belongs to
        nobody else is respected as human/session-owned and is never
        retroactively claimed.

        "Nobody else's" is asked of the shared-block owner rather than inferred
        from the label alone (#6999 F4).  A label another ORCHESTRATOR cause
        applied — a quarantined pending-work claim — is not human intent, and
        reading it as such left this escalation with no provenance at all: when
        the quarantine resolved it took the shared label with it, and an issue a
        human had been told to look at went quietly back on the board with
        neither the block nor the marker :meth:`reconcile` recovers from.  So
        the marker is recorded in that case too; only genuine human/session
        intent suppresses it.

        Each step also carries an expected-state guard so a concurrent human or
        orchestrator path that clears or pauses the escalation between our steps
        stops the sequence instead of stamping needs-human or a comment onto
        state that no longer holds: the marker add refuses a paused issue, the
        needs-human add requires the marker to still be present, and the
        durable comment/event requires the blocking label and, for state this
        lifecycle owns, its marker.
