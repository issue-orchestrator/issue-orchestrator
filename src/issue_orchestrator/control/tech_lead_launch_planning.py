"""When a QUEUED tech-lead run may actually launch (#6994).

Admission (:mod:`.tech_lead_run_admission`) answers "should this run exist?".
This module answers the different question a TICK asks: of the runs that already
exist, which may start right now, and which of them should no longer exist at
all. The two are separated because a run can be admitted once and then wait many
ticks — behind the global barrier, behind capacity, behind an open provider
circuit — and the board moves underneath it in that window. Admitting a run is
never a standing licence to launch it.

Two rules live here, both consulted by
:func:`..control.reactive_tech_lead_planning.plan_tech_lead_launch_queue`:

* :func:`plan_tech_lead_launch_gate` — scope exclusivity. A global run is
  exclusive of every other tech-lead run, and a QUEUED one is a barrier.
* :func:`plan_tech_lead_launch_revalidation` — subject eligibility, re-asked
  against this tick's live evidence, so a run whose subject was closed or
  unblocked while it waited is withdrawn rather than launched.

They are free functions, not coordinator methods, so the planner can consult the
rules without constructing an admission coordinator — while there is still only
one implementation of each.

       session has drained — that is what makes it exclusive rather than merely
       first in line. Which queued global gets the turn is decided by

       the shared ledger promotes by, so the two can never nominate different

    2. An ACTIVE global run holds everything back until it completes.
    3. Otherwise every queued targeted run is launchable; the numeric budget
