"""Tech-lead reaction policy for blocked/failed issue problems (#6780).

This is the single policy owner for the reactive side of ADR-0031:

* failed/timed-out sessions remain immediate investigation candidates;
* an explicit block is investigated only when dependency policy cannot
  explain it as healthy waiting on a tracked open issue, and only when the
  blocked issue has downstream dependents;
* a time-bounded cohort at or above the configured storm threshold suppresses
  per-issue investigations and requests one unscheduled health review. Cohort
  membership is a strict subset of the problems an investigation covers: a
  problem too minor to investigate individually cannot make the board look
  stormy, because there would be nothing for the escalation to suppress.

The classifier is pure and deterministic. It consumes the immutable planner
snapshot plus an injected clock and returns facts for the planner to map onto
actions. The completion-side helper records problem facts at the same policy
boundary. Queue mutation and GitHub issue creation stay at their existing
owner boundaries.
