"""The single owner of the orchestrator's paused state.

Every pause and resume in the system funnels through :class:`PauseController`.
That is a deliberate response to how the state used to be managed: four modules
assigned ``OrchestratorState.paused`` directly, so the event, the log line, and
the durable record each depended on whichever call site happened to remember
them. Two call sites remembered none, five recorded no reason, and nothing was
persisted at all.

Concentrating the transition here means the provenance is structural rather than
conventional — a caller *cannot* pause without naming a reason and an actor,
because those are required arguments, and the event/log/journal fan-out happens
once, in one place, for every path.

The controller owns the transition; it does not own the policy of *when* to
pause. Callers decide that and say why.
