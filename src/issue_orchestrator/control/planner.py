"""Planner - pure policy decisions.

The planner answers "should we?" questions without side effects.
It takes an immutable snapshot of state and returns a Plan describing
what actions should be taken.

This separation from the orchestrator enables:
- Pure, fast tests (no mocks for tmux/GitHub)
- Explainability ("why didn't issue X run?")
- Reuse across execution strategies (tmux, cloud)

Rule of thumb:
- "Should we?" → Planner (this module)
- "Can we?" → Orchestrator
- "How?" → Adapters

Usage:
    snapshot = orchestrator.create_snapshot()
    plan = planner.plan(snapshot)
    orchestrator.apply(plan)
