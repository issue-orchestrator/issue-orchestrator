"""Tech Lead board publisher: the projection sink for tech_lead facts (#6781).

Runs at fact-gathering time, whenever the tech_lead anchor scan produced facts
(the health-review-relevant cadence). Two fire-and-forget effects, in the
same spirit as the fact gatherer's event sink — projections of observed
facts, never decisions:

1. retain the latest open case-file facts behind a read-only injected reader
   so the board snapshot builder projects the ledger into later snapshots;
2. render the operator-facing tech_lead board markdown
   (:mod:`..view_models.tech_lead_board`) and write it to
   ``.issue-orchestrator/state/tech-lead-board.md``, throttled by content
   comparison — the render is deterministic and hour-granular, so unchanged
   ledgers cost zero writes.

Publish failures are logged, never raised: a projection write must not fail
the planning tick (the ledgers themselves stay authoritative in SQLite).
