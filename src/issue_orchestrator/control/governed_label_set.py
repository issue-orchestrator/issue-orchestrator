"""The governed label, enforced at the capability rather than by spelling.

An AST check can only see how a label is WRITTEN. It cannot see
``for label in record.pr_labels: labels.add_label(pr.number, label)``, where the
value arrives from an agent's completion record at runtime, or
``for label in action.add_labels``, where it arrives from a collection the
planner assembled. Both are real paths, and both could put the shared
``needs-human`` block on an issue or a PR with no cause recorded against it
(#6999 F2 round 4) — after which a typed release sees no independent cause and
takes away a block somebody still needed.

So the rule lives where the mutation actually happens. Every holder of a
:class:`~..ports.label_set.LabelSet` except the block owner receives this
wrapper, which refuses the configured shared label BY VALUE. The owner keeps the
raw capability, which is what makes it the only writer in fact and not merely by
convention: there is no spelling, no dynamic value and no new call site that can
route around a capability the caller was never given.

The tech-lead approval model's labels (``tech-lead-proposal``,
``awaiting-approval``, ``approved``) are withheld the same way (#7763 review
r9 F1): their only writer is the approval owner
(``control/tech_lead_approval_writes``), which holds the raw repository. A
generic label action, a Goal Pilot label update or an agent's ``pr_labels``
writing ``approved`` through an engine whose token belongs to a maintainer
would otherwise read as that maintainer's positive approval.

The refusal is an exception rather than a silent skip. A caller that tried to
apply this label wanted a human to look at the issue; swallowing that would turn
a mis-routed block into no block at all, which is the failure mode this whole
boundary exists to prevent. Callers that legitimately handle collections catch
it and report the label they could not apply.
