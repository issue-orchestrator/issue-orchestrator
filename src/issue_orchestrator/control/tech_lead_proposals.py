"""Gated tech_lead proposal issues (#6778, amends ADR-0031 §2).

Consequential tech_lead proposals become **gated GitHub issues** carrying
:data:`~..domain.tech_lead_session.PROPOSED_TECH_LEAD_LABEL`. Removing the label is
per-instance operator approval. This module is the single policy owner for
the whole gated lifecycle:

* **Composition** — :func:`build_tech_lead_proposal_issue_action` turns an
  act-level decision proposal under ``propose`` authority into a
  :class:`CreateTechLeadProposalIssueAction` carrying the typed
  :class:`StoredTechLeadOp`. The issue body is human documentation ONLY.
* **Creation boundary** —
  :func:`tech_lead_issue_creation.apply_create_tech_lead_issue` is the shared
  create-issue executor. Proposal creations record the op create-once in the
  orchestrator-owned authority store and link the issue from the tech_lead
  session's anchor. Execution later consumes only the stored op, so editing
  the issue body after creation has zero effect (the tamper boundary).
* **Ledger dedup** — one open proposal per (op, target):
  :func:`build_op_ledger` projects the store's rows; a duplicate proposal
  plans an :class:`AddCommentAction` on the existing proposal issue instead
  of filing a second one (:func:`build_duplicate_proposal_comment`).
* **Approval backlog** — :func:`observe_gated_tech_lead_proposals` answers
  "what is waiting on the operator?" from LABEL truth over the open issues a
  tick already observed, because only act-level proposals leave a ledger row
  (#7014). It is the visibility counterpart to reconciliation below.
* **Reconciliation** — :func:`reconcile_tech_lead_proposals` is the lifecycle
  owner that partitions the fact gatherer's EXHAUSTIVE open-issue scan (#6779
  R2/R4) against the durable ledger in one pass: a gate-labeled issue is an
  open proposal; an op-backed issue WITHOUT the gate label was approved; a
  ledger row whose issue is absent from the scan is only a CANDIDATE for
  terminal cleanup (#6779 R7) — the scan can be truncated, so absence alone
  never proves terminality. Reconciliation stays READ-ONLY: it classifies but
  does not mutate the ledger. Anchor classification runs on the remainder so a
  proposal issue can never be mistaken for a batch/health anchor.
* **Terminal cleanup** — :func:`apply_discard_terminal_tech_lead_proposal_ops` is
  the single mutating boundary the applier invokes on a
  :class:`DiscardTerminalTechLeadProposalOpsAction` the planner emitted from the
  absent-candidate fact. It CONFIRMS each candidate with a fresh targeted read
  before discarding, so a paginated scan gap can never delete a live op.
* **Approval planning** — :func:`plan_approved_tech_lead_op_executions` turns
  approved ops into the typed execution actions (``reset_retry`` reuses the
  #6777 executor + stale policy verbatim; ``kill_hung_session`` uses its own
  executor in ``tech_lead_kill_session``).
* **Terminal handling** — :func:`finalize_tech_lead_op_execution` posts the
  outcome comment on the proposal issue, closes it, and discards the op for
  executed AND stale outcomes (stale = "preconditions no longer hold": the
  executor posted no mutations). A loud executor failure leaves the op in
  place so the next tick retries. ``discard_op`` after terminal handling
  plus create-once recording makes ops execute at most once.

    EXECUTE, so it can afford to look only at ledger-backed issues; visibility

    ledger, and an operator board that said ``None.``

    Callers pass whatever open-issue sets the tick ALREADY holds (the runnable
    board fetch, the exhaustive anchor scan); the union is deduplicated by
    issue number and ordered by it, so the projection is deterministic and
    costs zero GitHub calls. Only OPEN issues qualify: a closed issue is
    rejected or already handled, never awaiting approval.

    Pass EVERY set the tick holds, not just the worker board. That board is
    narrowed by configured agents, milestones, exclusion filters and a fetch
    limit, so it is a runnable-work fetch rather than the approval scope — a
    gated issue outside it is still waiting on an operator. Feeding only the
