"""Gated tech_lead proposal issues (#6778, amends ADR-0031 §2).

Consequential tech_lead proposals become **gated GitHub issues** carrying
:data:`~..domain.tech_lead_session.PROPOSED_TECH_LEAD_LABEL`. Removing the label is
per-instance operator approval. This module is the single policy owner for
the whole gated lifecycle:

* **Composition** — :func:`build_tech_lead_proposal_issue_action` turns an
  act-level decision proposal (propose-authority ``reset_retry``; every
  ``kill_hung_session`` until its direct tier ships) into a
  :class:`CreateTechLeadProposalIssueAction` carrying the typed
  :class:`StoredTechLeadOp`. The issue body is human documentation ONLY.
* **Creation boundary** —
  :func:`tech_lead_issue_creation.apply_create_tech_lead_issue` is the shared
  create-issue executor. Proposal creations record the op create-once in the
  orchestrator-owned authority store and link the issue from the tech_lead
  session's anchor. Execution later consumes only the stored op, so editing
  the issue body after creation has zero effect (the tamper boundary).
* **Ledger dedup** — one open proposal per (op, target):
  :func:`build_op_ledger` projects the store's rows; a duplicate proposal
  plans an :class:`AddCommentAction` on the existing proposal issue instead
  of filing a second one (:func:`build_duplicate_proposal_comment`).
* **Reconciliation** — :func:`reconcile_tech_lead_proposals` is the lifecycle
  owner that partitions the fact gatherer's EXHAUSTIVE open-issue scan (#6779
  R2/R4) against the durable ledger in one pass: a gate-labeled issue is an
  open proposal; an op-backed issue WITHOUT the gate label was approved; a
  ledger row whose issue is absent from the scan is only a CANDIDATE for
  terminal cleanup (#6779 R7) — the scan can be truncated, so absence alone
  never proves terminality. Reconciliation stays READ-ONLY: it classifies but
  does not mutate the ledger. Anchor classification runs on the remainder so a
  proposal issue can never be mistaken for a batch/health anchor.
* **Terminal cleanup** — :func:`apply_discard_terminal_tech_lead_proposal_ops` is
  the single mutating boundary the applier invokes on a
  :class:`DiscardTerminalTechLeadProposalOpsAction` the planner emitted from the
  absent-candidate fact. It CONFIRMS each candidate with a fresh targeted read
  before discarding, so a paginated scan gap can never delete a live op.
* **Approval planning** — :func:`plan_approved_tech_lead_op_executions` turns
  approved ops into the typed execution actions (``reset_retry`` reuses the
  #6777 executor + stale policy verbatim; ``kill_hung_session`` uses its own
  executor in ``tech_lead_kill_session``).
* **Terminal handling** — :func:`finalize_tech_lead_op_execution` posts the
  outcome comment on the proposal issue, closes it, and discards the op for
  executed AND stale outcomes (stale = "preconditions no longer hold": the
  executor posted no mutations). A loud executor failure leaves the op in
  place so the next tick retries. ``discard_op`` after terminal handling
  plus create-once recording makes ops execute at most once.
