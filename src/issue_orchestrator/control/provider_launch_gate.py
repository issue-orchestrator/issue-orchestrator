"""The one gate every launch path passes before spawning a session (#6999).

Two questions, always in this order:

1. Does the provider's own credential probe say it is authenticated?
2. If so, is its circuit open for some other (transient) reason?

The probe comes first even though it is the more expensive question, because it
is also the only way *out* of an auth outage: while the circuit is open no
session runs, so a gate that short-circuited on the open circuit could never
observe the human re-authenticating and would stall the fleet for the full auth
cooldown. The probe's own short-lived result cache keeps the real cost to about
one local, non-interactive CLI call per provider per minute.

Both answers arrive as typed values. Nothing here reads a banner, an exit code,
or circuit arithmetic: :class:`ProviderAvailabilityPolicy` owns the provider
questions and :class:`~.provider_resilience.ProviderResilienceManager` owns the
circuit. This module owns only the launch consequence — park or proceed — so
the five launch paths (issue, validation retry, review, retrospective review,
rework) cannot drift apart on it.

A refusal here is a ``PROVIDER_DEFERRED`` disposition, never a plain failure:
nothing about the work went wrong, so the queue that asked for the launch must
keep its item intact for a tick when the provider is ready (#6999 F10).
