"""Who requires the shared ``needs-human`` block, and why (#6999 F4/F2/A2).

``needs-human`` is ONE label with SEVERAL independent causes, and until this
module existed each owner reasoned about it from inside its OWN provenance
alone. That is not enough to decide a removal. The concrete loss: a quarantine
acquires ``needs-human``; while it is present another lifecycle comes to need
the same label, finds it already there and records nothing; the quarantine then
resolves and takes "its" label off. The second cause is left with neither the
block nor anything to recover it from, so an issue a human was told to look at
silently returns to the board.

Three orchestrator-owned causes exist, and each records itself durably:

* ``TECH_LEAD_ESCALATION`` — its own marker label
  (:mod:`.tech_lead_needs_human_reconcile`);
* ``CLAIM_QUARANTINE`` — its row in the quarantine ledger
  (:mod:`.claim_quarantine`);
* ``SESSION_LIFECYCLE`` — everything the planners escalate (a session that ended
  without a completion record, publish failures past their bound, an invalid
  completion record, a stuck sweep). These recorded NOTHING before (#6999 F2
  round 2), which is why the loss above stayed open for every cause but the
  tech-lead one. They now record a row through this owner.

Anything else wearing the label is operator intent, and is recognised by the
ABSENCE of any recorded cause rather than by a fourth token: a human does not
announce themselves, and a label nobody can account for is exactly what "a human
put this here" looks like.

Reads FAIL CLOSED: a cause that cannot be evaluated is reported as present,
because wrongly keeping a block costs a tick of attention and wrongly removing
one loses a human's only signal.

The label stays authoritative over the rows, never the other way round. A row
means "while this label is present, THIS lifecycle is one of the reasons for
it", so the moment the label goes — removed by an owner here, or by a human out
of band — every row for that issue goes with it. That is what stops a stale row
stranding an issue in ``needs-human`` forever, which is the failure mode a
provenance ledger invites if it is allowed to outlive what it describes.

Validated-work failures use record-scoped keys within this same registry. Their
retained FAILED dispositions remain the recovery owner's authority to reassert
the label after a generation ends. A release names one record, and an ordinary
force-clear cannot settle that disposition. The aggregate recovery owner must
serialize these calls with sibling admission under its issue mutation gate.
Within that scope, this owner holds its own cause-database gate across the full
label/provenance operation. Every lifecycle uses it, including scoped views and
reads that prune old causes; contention reports failure or a conservative hold.
The order is disposition gate then shared-block gate, never the reverse.
