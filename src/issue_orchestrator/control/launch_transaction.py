"""One launch, settled as one transaction (#6999 A2/F4).

A launch touches two records of the same request: the in-memory pending queue
it came off, and the durable claim ledger that has to survive a restart. Split
between a launcher that only knew how to defer and a settlement that only knew
how to mutate the queue, they could - and did - end a launch disagreeing:

* a permanently dropped item left a deferred row, which the startup sweep is
  built to re-admit, so "permanent" lasted until the next restart;
* an exhausted tech-lead retry budget was serialised before it was spent, so a
  restart refunded it and relaunched an investigation whose escalation to a
  human was already standing on the issue.

This module owns the whole span instead. :class:`PendingWorkLaunchClaim` takes
the durable claim before anything irreversible happens and
:func:`abandon_claim_unless_spawned` hands it back on every exit that started
no terminal; :class:`LaunchSettlement` then settles the queue AND the ledger
together, driven by one typed :class:`WorkDisposal`. Separated from
:mod:`.in_flight_work`, which owns the other span: what a LIVE terminal is
carrying, from its first byte until it dies.

    * a crash between the spawn and the write - or between the spawn and the
      launch's own destructive label transitions - left a running agent carrying
      a request with no durable record anywhere. For a tech-lead failure
      investigation the in-memory queue is the only other copy, so a restart

    * the store write had nowhere left to fail. By the time it ran the terminal
      was irreversible, so a claim-store fault could only be reported, never
      undone.

    So the claim is taken as soon as the run identity exists and before anything
    irreversible happens. A launch that never reaches a live terminal hands the
    work back through the same owner, by DEFERRING the row rather than deleting
    it: "deferred" already means *untouched, waiting to be relaunched*, which is
    exactly true here, and it keeps a durable record for the startup sweep to
    re-admit instead of trusting the in-memory queue to survive.

    still exists is the QUEUE owner's decision, and :meth:`settle_unspawned` is
    how it reaches the ledger (#6999 F4) - without it the two halves settle

           irreversible - so nothing that follows can refund the attempt;
        2. the queue is brought into line with it;
        3. only then does an exhausted budget run its external needs-human
           transition, and only a committed one drops the work.

        An escalation that does not commit leaves the request queued with its
        budget spent, so the next tick re-attempts the escalation rather than
        starting the budget again.

        The escalation in step 3 and the ledger retire that follows it straddle
        two stores - GitHub and SQLite - so they cannot be made one atomic act,
        and their ordering is a deliberate choice
        of which way to fail. Retiring the row first would mean a death in that
        window loses the work with nobody told about it. Escalating first means
        a death in that window leaves a recoverable row whose budget is already
        at its bound: the work comes back, the human has already been told, and
        the next settlement re-asserts the same idempotent escalation and drops
        it again. One redundant attempt is recoverable; a silently discarded
        investigation is not.
