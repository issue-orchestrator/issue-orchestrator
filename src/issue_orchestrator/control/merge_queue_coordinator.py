"""Single owner of GitHub Merge Queue policy.

When ``merge_queue.enabled`` is true, this coordinator owns every final
merge-readiness decision for a reviewer-approved PR: eligibility, the
stale/conflict classification, the enqueue decision, and failure routing.
Keeping that policy in one place is the point of the feature — stale checks,
review gates, and queue outcomes must not drift across planner/review/tech_lead
code paths.

Layering note: the coordinator runs inside the awaiting-merge *discovery*
phase, so it only ever *reads* from the repository host (the queue entry) and
*emits observational events*. It never mutates the queue here — the actual
``enqueuePullRequest`` mutation is carried as a ``DiscoveredMergeQueueEnqueue``
fact through the planner into the ActionApplier, honoring the
Observer -> Planner -> ActionApplier contract.
