"""Builds a BoardSnapshot from OrchestratorState - facts only, no decisions.

Observation-flavored code: this module gathers facts from orchestrator state
and injected readers, and makes no decisions and no GitHub/network calls.
Every external data source (timeline store, orchestrator log, wall clock) is
an injected callable so the builder is deterministic and trivially testable:

- ``timeline_reader``: typically a lambda over the orchestrator's owned
  ``TimelineStore.read`` (wired at the composition root over the same store
  instance the timeline writer uses; control must not import execution
  directly, and the builder must not open a second store path to the db).
- ``log_tail_provider``: returns the last N lines of the orchestrator log.
- ``clock``: returns the current time; session ages are computed against it
  (never against ``datetime.now()`` internally).

Defensive bounds: the snapshot is written to a file that an agent with a
finite context window reads, so every list is capped - sessions, queue
entries, blocked issues, and failures at ``MAX_LIST_ENTRIES`` (100) each,
timeline extracts at ``MAX_TIMELINE_ISSUES`` (10) issues of at most
``timeline_limit`` records, and each log line / queue detail at
``MAX_LINE_CHARS`` (500) characters.

        is NOT derived from ``failures``: the failure list is deliberately
        broad context (live buffer + every pending investigation + every
        pending cohort), so reading authority back out of it granted reviews
        scope over unrelated issues (#6780). Unlike the other list
        fields it is not truncated — a cohort is a small, exact grant, and
        silently dropping a member would shrink authority rather than bound a
        display.

        Failures are an explicit parameter rather than read from
        ``state.discovered_failures`` because that field is a per-tick fact
        buffer: the observer appends to it during a tick and the orchestrator
        clears it alongside the other discovered facts after planning (see

        tick it is usually empty, so callers must pass the failures they want
        surfaced (e.g. captured at completion time, or
        ``state.discovered_failures`` when building mid-tick).
