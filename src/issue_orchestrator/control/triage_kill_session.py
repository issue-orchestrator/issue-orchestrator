"""Execution-time owner for approved triage ``kill_hung_session`` ops (#6778).

The gated-proposal tier made ``kill_hung_session`` plannable (ADR-0031 §2
amendment); this module makes executing an APPROVED op safe. Mirrors
``triage_reset_retry``: the stored op is a stale-checkable fact recorded
against the board the proposing session observed, so the executor
re-validates immediately before acting:

1. the target issue must STILL have an active session — the entire point of
   the op is terminating live-but-stuck work, so a session that already
   exited (completed, crashed, was reset) makes the proposal stale.

On a stale precondition the op DOWNGRADES exactly like ``reset_retry``:
``publish_proposal_surfaced`` emits ``TRIAGE_ACTION_PROPOSED`` with
``mode="stale_downgrade"`` and no mutations are posted (the applier's
finalizer then closes the proposal issue with a "preconditions no longer
hold" comment). On success a ``TRIAGE_ACTION_EXECUTED`` event records the
termination boundary effects. Kill-owner failures fail the action loudly.

The termination itself is NOT reimplemented here: ``run_kill`` is the
injected production boundary — ``terminate_issue_runtime`` via
``Orchestrator.terminate_issue_runtime_for_issue``, the same issue-terminal
boundary the reset owner applies, WITHOUT the reset (no PR superseding, no
label/history clearing, no relaunch). Production wiring lives in
``entrypoints/triage_reset_retry_wiring.py``.
