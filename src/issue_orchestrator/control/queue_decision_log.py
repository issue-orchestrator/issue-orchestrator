"""On-change logging of the per-issue *queue* decision (launch vs. skip + why).

Extracted from the planner: it is the same "log a coarse control decision only
when it changes" concern as the tech_lead launch log, so it delegates the
keyed on-change cache and stale-key pruning to the shared ``DecisionChangeLog``
owner and keeps only what is queue-specific — the message formatting and the
periodic summary. Behavior is unchanged: the ``trace-queue-decision`` /
``trace-queue-summary`` lines and their ``issue=%d`` keying (so
``issue-orchestrator trace <n>`` surfaces them) are preserved verbatim. Events
remain the machine contract; this is the additive human line.
