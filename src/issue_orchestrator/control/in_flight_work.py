"""Ownership of queued work from launch to terminal settlement (#6999 A1/F2).

Before this module the pending queues had an owner only up to the moment a
session spawned. The launch settlement decided whether a *launch outcome*
consumed the work, removed the item, and stopped there — so from the terminal's
first byte until it died, nothing in the system still knew that the running
session was carrying a request.

That gap lost work. A session launched from a queue, ran, and then hit an
expired provider credential took the ordinary BLOCKED completion path, which
records the outage and releases the issue claim but has no request to give back:

* a tech-lead failure investigation carries its typed ``DiscoveredFailure`` in
  the queue item and nowhere else — dropping it loses the investigation;
* a validation retry carries its original prompt, validation error, retry count
  and source task in the queue item — a BLOCKED status does not take the
  ``NEEDS_VALIDATION_RETRY`` reconstruction branch, so the retry evaporates;
* a rework has its ``needs-rework`` trigger removed at launch, so neither the
  queue nor the labels are left holding it.

:class:`InFlightWorkLedger` closes that span. A launch hands it the typed claim;
terminal completion hands it back a typed :class:`SettlementOutcome`. Consuming
the work and returning it are the same decision made in one place, so no
completion path can reconstruct work from terminal-name prefixes or scattered
labels, and none can quietly forget to.

The other end of the same request's life - taking the claim before a terminal
spawns, and settling queue and ledger together when one never does - lives in
:mod:`.launch_transaction`. Split because they are different spans with
different failure modes, and only that module may depend on this one.
