"""Single policy owner for orchestrator-created tech_lead issues (ADR-0031).

Two paths create GitHub issues on tech_lead's behalf and MUST share one policy:

* the planner's batch-review tracking issue (``_plan_tech_lead_issue_creation``),
* decision-driven follow-up issues (``create_issue`` proposals in a tech_lead
  decision artifact, executed by ``tech_lead_decision_actions``).

This module owns how the ``tech_lead:`` config section (explicit labels,
inherited labels, priority, milestone strategy) turns into concrete issue
labels/milestones/titles, and which agent-proposed labels are acceptable at
all. Agent-proposed labels are untrusted input: anything matching a
workflow/protected family (orchestrator lifecycle labels, ``needs-*``,
``*-reviewed``, ``*-failed``, ``publish-*``, ``blocked*``, ``agent:*``,
``tech_lead:*``) is rejected so a decision artifact can never corrupt label
truth (ADR-0013). Concrete orchestrator-owned names are derived from
config/:class:`LabelManager`, not re-hardcoded here.

GitHub label names are case-insensitive, so every comparison in this module
casefolds — an agent must not bypass protection (or defeat inheritance or
dedup) by case-flipping a name.

The module is pure policy: the milestone strategy becomes a typed
:class:`TechLeadMilestoneIntent` at planning time (:func:`tech_lead_issue_milestone_intent`),
and the explicit NAME -> number resolution runs ONCE at the create-issue
execution boundary (:func:`resolve_tech_lead_milestone_number`, called by the
action applier with ``RepositoryHost.list_milestones`` passed in) — never at
planning or completion time (#6769 finding 4).
