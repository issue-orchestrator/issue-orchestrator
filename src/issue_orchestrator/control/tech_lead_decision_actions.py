"""Map a validated tech_lead decision to orchestrator actions (ADR-0031).

Pure policy: no IO, no events. The tech lead agent proposed actions as intent;
this module applies the configured graduated authority per action type and
emits the orchestrator's action vocabulary:

- ``execute`` authority -> the concrete action (comment, issue, escalation).
- ``propose`` authority -> a shadow :class:`SurfaceTechLeadProposalAction` for
  ``post_comment``/``escalate_to_human``/``flag_pattern`` (the
  immediate/report tier).
- ``create_issue`` with ``propose`` authority -> the issue is CREATED, gated
  with ``proposed-tech-lead`` (#6778): removing the label flows it into normal
  scheduling. The gate label is orchestrator-attached by the
  ``tech_lead_issue_policy`` owner and rejected by the agent-label allowlist.
- ``create_issue`` that the agent itself CITED as a duplicate, where the dedup
  gate cannot route the observation onto the candidate as a comment -> the
  observation accrues to the durable case-file ledger instead of minting a new
  open issue (#6989, routing owned by ``tech_lead_observation_routing``). This
  is what stops one standing problem from growing one new open issue per
  health review.
- ``flag_pattern`` with ``execute`` authority -> surfaced with
  ``mode="pattern"`` PLUS the durable case-file ledger (#6781): a signature
  absent from the pattern ledger plans a
  :class:`~.actions.CreateTechLeadCaseFileIssueAction` (the applier records
  the signature -> issue row create-once); a known signature plans an
  evidence ``AddCommentAction`` on the existing case file. Under
  ``propose`` authority it stays a shadow record like any other proposal.
- Act-level proposals with ``execute`` authority -> typed
  :class:`ResetRetryIssueAction` / :class:`KillHungSessionAction` commands;
  each applier owner re-validates the proposal's preconditions at execution
  time and downgrades stale proposals to a surfaced record (#6764, ADR-0031
  §2).
- Act-level proposals under ``propose`` ->
  GATED PROPOSAL ISSUES (#6778): a
  :class:`~.actions.CreateTechLeadProposalIssueAction` whose applier creates
  the issue AND records the executable :class:`StoredTechLeadOp` create-once.
  Removing the gate label is per-instance approval; the fact gatherer's
  label scan then triggers execution of the STORED op. Dedup is
  ledger-based: one open proposal per (op, target) — a re-proposal plans an
  ``AddCommentAction`` on the existing proposal issue instead.

Shadow proposals additionally plan ONE durable would-have-done digest
comment on the tech_lead session's anchor issue. The trace event alone is not
an operator surface: ADR-0031 §2 requires shadow records to be visible "in
the report, as a structured event, and on the escalation surface", and the
escalation surface in this codebase is the crash-safe GitHub label/comment
channel that the dashboard projects (#6761 finding 6). Gated proposals do
NOT appear in the digest — their surface is the proposal issue itself,
linked from the anchor by the creation applier.

Decision-driven ``create_issue`` proposals are composed by the
``tech_lead_issue_policy`` owner: configured tech_lead labels/priority/milestone
strategy apply exactly as they do to the planner's batch tracking issue, and
agent labels have already passed the protected-label contract check
(``tech_lead_completion``).

Escalation note: tech_lead escalation deliberately does NOT reuse
``EscalateToHumanAction``. That action's applier terminates the target
issue's runtime ("escalation kills issue automation, full stop"), which
would let the always-execute ``escalate_to_human`` floor reach the same
effect as ``kill_hung_session`` while bypassing that action's explicit
authority dial and exact-session-generation revalidation. Tech Lead escalation
is strictly a routing
surface: needs-human label + explanatory comment on the target; nothing
is stopped and no other labels are touched.
