"""Tech-lead action dataclasses (ADR-0031 / #6778 / #6781 / #6957).

Split out of ``actions`` for cohesion and its line budget as the tech-lead
surface grew: gated proposal issues, pattern case files, act-level ops, and the
finding-promotion lane. The split is ONE-WAY and the dependency ROOT is
``action_base``: this module imports :class:`~.action_base.Action` and
:class:`~.action_base.ActionType` from there directly — never from ``actions``,
which imports THIS module and would therefore be only partially initialized
(#6957 review F7). ``actions`` re-exports every name here, so importers are
unaffected. ``tests/unit/control/test_action_module_boundaries.py`` pins the
