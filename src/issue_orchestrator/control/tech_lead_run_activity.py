"""The owner of a tech-lead run's LOCAL record (ADR-0033 / #6858).

Three owners already touch a tech-lead run's life and none of them remembers
it: :class:`..control.tech_lead_run_admission.TechLeadRunCoordinator` decides a
run should exist, :class:`..control.tech_lead_launch_authority.TechLeadLaunchAuthority`
is the single gate a session may start behind, and
:class:`..control.tech_lead_run_ownership.TechLeadRunOwnership` coordinates who
owns it across engines. This owner is the fourth question — *what happened* —
and it is deliberately separate from all three, because a receipt written by a
decision-maker is a decision-maker with a second job.

Two seams, one on each side of a session's life:

* :meth:`TechLeadRunActivity.note_started` — called by the launch authority the
  instant a session exists, so the record is opened by the same gate that
  guarantees at most one session per run. Recording it anywhere earlier (at
  admission, say) would mint a record for every queued run that never starts.
* :meth:`TechLeadRunActivity.note_concluded` — called from
  ``finalize_terminal_outcome``, the POST-APPLY terminal seam that also commits
  the terminal trace event, the cached state machine, and the session history.
  Deliberately not from ``process_completion``: the authoritative terminal status
  does not exist yet there, so concluding early recorded COMPLETED for runs whose
  mandated action then failed and whose real outcome was FAILED — and the
  once-only guard made that first wrong answer permanent (#6858 round 1 F3).

This owner also decides WHEN a run's artifacts are preserved, because that is the
same event as concluding it: the run's evidence lives in a worktree that cleanup
is about to remove, so it is copied to the engine-owned archive at the terminal
seam and the locator is written with the verdict (#6858 round 1 F4).

Everything this owner writes is best-effort by contract (see
:mod:`...ports.tech_lead_run_record_store` and
:mod:`...ports.tech_lead_run_artifact_archive`): a tech-lead run's product is its
proposals, and losing the receipt must never lose the run.
