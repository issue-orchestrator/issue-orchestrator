"""The ONE place a tech-lead session may start (#6994 round 2 F2 / A2).

Admission decides that a run *should* exist. The planner decides which queued
runs *look* launchable this tick. Neither is authority to START one, and before
this owner existed the difference did not matter because there was no single
gate: the reactive tick reached the launch through the planner (which consulted
the scope gate against a snapshot taken BEFORE that same tick's actions ran),
while the one-shot CLI called ``launch_tech_lead_session`` directly and consulted
nothing. Two paths, two authorities, one bypassable invariant.

So every path now funnels through :meth:`TechLeadLaunchAuthority.launch`, and it
re-decides everything that could have changed since planning, in the order that
makes each answer cheap before the expensive one:

1. **Subject eligibility**, re-asked against GitHub right now. A run can wait
   many ticks behind the global barrier and its subject can be closed, unblocked
   or (for a whole-repository review) already completed by a peer in that
   window. A focused investigation withdraws only on POSITIVE evidence; a global
   run fails CLOSED and must prove its anchor is still open (round 2 F9).
2. **Scope exclusivity against LIVE state** — this engine's pending queue and
   active sessions as they are at this instant, not as a plan-time snapshot
   remembered them. That closes the within-tick bypass where a tick creates a
   global anchor and then executes an already-planned targeted launch.
3. **The shared run ledger** — the atomic, cross-engine half of the same rule
   (:meth:`TechLeadRunOwnership.begin_run`). Local state cannot see a peer's
   runs, so the local gate alone is an optimisation, never the boundary.

Only then does the real launch run. A refusal leaves the run QUEUED (it retries
next tick) except when revalidation withdrew it, and a launch that fails to
produce a session hands the ledger entry straight back so a peer is not made to
wait out a lease for work that never started.
