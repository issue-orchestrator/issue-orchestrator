"""Behaviour-complete termination of a tech-lead session (#6824 R7).

Extracted from the orchestrator facade, which coordinates rather than executes:
the effects below and — more importantly — the rule that each is attempted
INDEPENDENTLY are policy, and policy belongs beside the typed outcome it
produces rather than inside a facade method.

``kill_session`` only stops the terminal, and the one-shot driver that calls
this runs NO further tick afterwards — so a recorded cleanup fact would never be
applied. The termination is therefore self-contained, mirroring the outcomes
normal completion produces: remove the session state machine, stop the terminal,
reconcile the session out of ``active_sessions``, release BOTH coordination
holds (the per-issue claim and the repository-wide tech-lead run), and
FORCE-remove the disposable scratch worktree.

Both coordination layers, deliberately (#6994 round 2 F10/A7). The per-issue
claim says who may write to an issue; the run hold says which whole-repository
or focused tech-lead run is executing. Releasing only the first leaves every
conflicting tech-lead run blocked until the lease expires, with no later tick to
notice — so the run release is its own independent effect with its own field in
the typed outcome.

A failure of one effect never aborts the others, and the result is a typed
:class:`~.tech_lead_trigger.TechLeadTerminationOutcome` — the SOLE owner of a
failed one-shot cleanup. On a scratch-worktree removal failure the outcome
carries the exact ``leaked_worktree`` path so the caller can require explicit
operator removal; there is no second, tick-based retry mechanism to defer to.
