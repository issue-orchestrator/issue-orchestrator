"""Execution-time owner for triage ``reset_retry`` proposals (ADR-0031 §2, #6764).

Authority made ``reset_retry`` plannable; this module makes executing it
safe. A proposal is a stale-checkable fact recorded against a board
snapshot, not a command: by the time the triage session completes, the
board may have moved. The executor therefore re-validates the proposal's
preconditions against CURRENT state immediately before invoking the reset
owner:

1. the target issue can still be read and is still open;
2. no active session is running for the issue — the reset boundary
   force-terminates issue runtime, which an operator clicking
   "Reset & Retry" consents to, but an agent proposal written before a
   new session started must never kill unobserved live work;
3. the issue still carries at least one blocking-class label
   (:meth:`LabelManager.get_blocking` — the same classification the retry
   entry points clear via ``labels_to_remove_for_retry``). If nothing
   blocking remains, the diagnosed failure has already been recovered and
   the proposal is stale.

On a stale precondition the proposal DOWNGRADES (ADR-0031 §2): the
surfaced-proposal event (``TRIAGE_ACTION_PROPOSED`` with
``mode="stale_downgrade"``) is emitted and no mutations are posted. On
success a ``TRIAGE_ACTION_EXECUTED`` event records the boundary effects.
Reset-owner failures fail the action loudly — never a silent success.

This module is also the single authoritative outcome boundary for
completion terminalization: :class:`RequiredActLevelOutcome` /
:func:`evaluate_required_act_level_outcome` fold the applied results into
one verdict ("did the mandated act-level action commit?"), and
:func:`effective_terminal_status` turns that verdict into the ONE terminal
status the whole post-apply completion phase consumes — so the observer,
failure discovery, retry gating, cleanup reason, operator surface, and
history all agree, never split between the agent's reported status and this
verdict (#6764 re-review F2). :func:`finalize_required_act_level_history`
keeps the persisted history row consistent with that status, and
:func:`build_required_act_level_failure_actions` routes a failed mandated
reset to a durable needs-human label + comment so the FAILED terminal is not
merely in-memory. A failed mandated reset can therefore never be recorded as
a clean success.

The reset itself is NOT reimplemented here: ``run_reset`` is the injected
production boundary — the same ``reset_and_retry_issue`` pipeline the
dashboard's ``/api/reset-retry`` endpoint uses (runtime termination, PR
superseding, branch deletion, label/history/timeline clearing,
pending-label relaunch marking, and queue re-insertion). Production wiring
lives in ``entrypoints/triage_reset_retry_wiring.py``.

This module also owns the surfaced-proposal event payload
(:func:`publish_proposal_surfaced`) so the shadow/pattern/rejected surface
handler and the stale-downgrade path cannot drift apart.
