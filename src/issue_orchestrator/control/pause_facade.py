"""The orchestrator facade's pause surface, kept out of the facade module.

`infra/orchestrator.py` is far over its line budget, and it already delegates
its tick and planning bodies to `control/` helpers. The pause methods belong
here for the same reason: they hold no logic of their own — each takes the
state lock and hands the decision to `PauseController` — so housing them beside
that owner keeps the pause vocabulary in one neighbourhood.

These take their collaborators explicitly rather than an orchestrator. Control
may not import `infra` (it reaches `execution` and `subprocess` transitively,
breaking two architecture contracts), and naming the two or three things each
function touches is a truer statement of the dependency than the whole facade.
