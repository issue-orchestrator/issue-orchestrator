"""The launch-time dependency and stack-base gate.

Scheduling and launching are separated by a tick or more, and everything the
schedule was decided on can move in between: a predecessor branch advances, a
review re-opens, an issue body is rewritten. So every launch path re-asks the
work gate immediately before it commits to a worktree, and this is the one place
that asking lives.

It exists as its own owner because the answer is not a boolean. A launch needs
three distinguishable outcomes - proceed on the default base, proceed seeded
from a named predecessor branch, or fail closed - and collapsing any of them
into the others is how a stack successor silently gets rebased onto the default
branch (#6596 F1). The launcher therefore holds this gate rather than the
evaluator, the issue-refresh callback and the event sink it would otherwise have
to combine correctly at four separate call sites.
