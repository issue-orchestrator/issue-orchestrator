"""Completion processor - handles agent completion records.

This controller reads CompletionRecords written by coding-done/reviewer-done and executes
the appropriate actions via adapters.

Architecture principle: The agent reports intent; the orchestrator decides and executes.

The agent does NOT:
- Push code
- Create PRs
- Post comments
- Mutate labels

All those actions are performed here after validating the completion record
as untrusted input.
