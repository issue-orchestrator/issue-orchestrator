"""Consume :class:`BackgroundJobRunner` completions from the main tick.

The raw runner exposes a polling surface (``is_running`` / ``drain_completed``)
but no callers actually drained it, so background job **failures** never
reached the control layer. A crashed review-exchange thread would exit, the
tick would observe no running job and no ``summary.json``, and
:meth:`CompletionReviewExchange.run_review_exchange_if_needed` would happily
resubmit the same job — forever, once per tick, silently. This supervisor
plugs that gap.

Contract:

* :meth:`tick` is called once per main-loop iteration (or whenever the
  orchestrator reaches a safe point to reap completions). It drains the
  runner and records any exceptions under the corresponding ``job_id``.
* :meth:`take_failure` returns and clears a recorded failure so callers
  can surface it as a terminal outcome (e.g. mark the session FAILED)
  instead of spawning a fresh attempt.
* ``submit`` / ``is_running`` delegate to the underlying runner so
  consumers depend on the supervisor and nothing else.
