"""Reactive tech_lead planning: the tech-lead reaction as actions (#6780).

Owner for the ONE atomic decision a tick makes about discovered problems:
escalate a time-bounded cohort to a single unscheduled health-review anchor,
or queue the individual failure investigations — and, either way, whether the
already-queued members may launch this tick.

The split of responsibilities around this module:

- ``tech_lead_reaction.TechLeadReactionPolicy`` CLASSIFIES (which problems are
  tech-lead-worthy, which form a storm). It touches no queues and decides no
  suppression.
- this module MAPS that reaction onto persist-first actions, and owns the
  suppression rule.
- ``health_review_trigger`` owns anchor creation policy and the intake that
  COLLAPSES a cohort once it is durably persisted.

It lives outside ``planner.py`` because the reaction is a policy in its own
right — the planner's job is to order and assemble a tick's actions, not to
host the reaction model's rules (which is also what keeps the planner's
oversized-hotspot budget from absorbing every new reaction rule).

    """Outcome of the tech-lead reaction for one tick (#6780).

    ``actions`` ALWAYS queues the individual investigations the classifier
    selected, and appends the storm/periodic health-review anchor when one can
    be created. Queue-then-collapse is deliberate: the pending queue is the
    only CROSS-TICK carrier of a problem once ``discovered_failures`` is
    cleared at end of tick (it is in-memory only — failure investigations have
    no GitHub anchor and are not recovered on restart — so it outlives the
    tick, not the process). The cohort is therefore persisted FIRST, and a
    successfully created anchor collapses it at intake
    (``_queue_anchor_by_marker`` removes the superseded investigations and
    stamps ``problem_cohort`` onto the pending health review in one step).
    Planning the anchor *instead of* the investigations would lose the cohort
    whenever the create never lands — a GitHub failure or the tech_lead cooldown,
    both invisible to the planner.

    ``suppressed_issue_numbers`` governs LAUNCH timing only, never retention:
    it holds back already-queued member investigations on the tick the cohort
    is escalated, since intake is about to collapse them. If the anchor create
    then fails, those items simply remain queued and launch on a later tick.

    AFTER them, so that on a successful create the intake owner
    (``_queue_anchor_by_marker``) collapses the cohort atomically: it removes

    pending health review, from which the launch authority's
    ``problem_issue_numbers`` later derive.

    Suppression is therefore never the thing that decides retention: every
    path that leaves the cohort without an anchor — an existing or pending
    health review, no capacity, paused, a failed GitHub create, or the
    apply-time tech_lead cooldown — leaves the individual investigations queued,
    and they self-heal into one consolidated health review on a later tick
