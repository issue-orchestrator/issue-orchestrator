"""Reactive tech_lead planning: the tech-lead reaction as actions (#6780).

Owner for the ONE atomic decision a tick makes about discovered problems:
escalate a time-bounded cohort to a single unscheduled health-review anchor,
or queue the individual failure investigations — and, either way, whether the
already-queued members may launch this tick.

The split of responsibilities around this module:

- ``tech_lead_reaction.TechLeadReactionPolicy`` CLASSIFIES (which problems are
  tech-lead-worthy, which form a storm). It touches no queues and decides no
  suppression.
- this module MAPS that reaction onto persist-first actions, and owns the
  suppression rule.
- ``health_review_trigger`` owns anchor creation policy and the intake that
  COLLAPSES a cohort once it is durably persisted.

It lives outside ``planner.py`` because the reaction is a policy in its own
right — the planner's job is to order and assemble a tick's actions, not to
host the reaction model's rules (which is also what keeps the planner's
oversized-hotspot budget from absorbing every new reaction rule).

    ``actions`` ALWAYS queues the individual investigations the classifier
    selected, and appends the storm/periodic health-review anchor when one can
    be created. Queue-then-collapse is deliberate: the pending queue is the
    only CROSS-TICK carrier of a problem once ``discovered_failures`` is
    cleared at end of tick (it is in-memory only — failure investigations have
    no GitHub anchor and are not recovered on restart — so it outlives the
    tick, not the process). The cohort is therefore persisted FIRST, and a
    successfully created anchor collapses it at intake
    (``_queue_anchor_by_marker`` removes the superseded investigations and
    stamps ``problem_cohort`` onto the pending health review in one step).
    Planning the anchor *instead of* the investigations would lose the cohort
    whenever the create never lands — a GitHub failure or the tech_lead cooldown,
    both invisible to the planner.

    ``suppressed_issue_numbers`` governs LAUNCH timing only, never retention:
    it holds back already-queued member investigations on the tick the cohort
    is escalated, since intake is about to collapse them. If the anchor create
    then fails, those items simply remain queued and launch on a later tick.

    Answers the whole eligibility question, so the planner asks once — before
    it knows whether a slot is free. That ordering is deliberate: withdrawal is
    not a capacity decision, and with ``tech_lead.max_concurrent: 1`` a single
    active run leaves zero slots, so gating revalidation behind a free slot
    would strand a run whose subject is already gone for exactly as long as the
    other run takes — the very window the rule exists for.

    Three independent filters, in order, all applied BEFORE capacity and the
    provider gate so none is ever reported as a capacity skip — a distinction
    that matters to an operator, because "no capacity" invites raising
    ``tech_lead.max_concurrent``, which would not release a single held run:

    1. **Storm suppression** (#6780) — a failure investigation whose cohort was
       escalated to an anchor this tick. Logged rather than silently dropped, so
       its per-issue trace explains why it did not launch.
    2. **Launch-time revalidation** (#6994) — an investigation whose subject has
       since been closed or unblocked. Admission is not a standing licence to
       launch: a run can wait many ticks behind the global barrier, and the
       board moves underneath it. Refused runs are withdrawn, not held.
    3. **Scope exclusivity** (#6994) — a global run is exclusive of every other
       tech-lead run, and a queued one is a barrier.

    Both #6994 rules belong to the run-admission owner
    (:mod:`.tech_lead_run_admission`); this assembles their verdicts into a
    tick's plan. It lives here for the same reason the reaction model does: the
    planner's job is to order and assemble a tick's actions, not to host the
