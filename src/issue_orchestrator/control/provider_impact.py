"""Issue-scoped provider-impact transitions (issue #5980).

The fleet-scoped ``provider.*`` events emitted by
:class:`~issue_orchestrator.control.provider_resilience.ProviderResilienceManager`
describe *a circuit*, not *an issue*: they carry no ``issue_number``, and
``DefaultTimelineWriter`` drops every event without one. That left the
provider-blocked label as the only signal that an outage stalled a specific
issue — and the label is shed the moment the circuit closes, so the outage
vanished from issue history exactly when an operator would go looking for it.

:class:`ApplyProviderImpactAction` is the owner command for "a provider outage
started / stopped affecting this issue". It owns *both* halves of the
transition — the blocked-label mutation and the durable issue-scoped record —
so no call site can move the label without leaving history behind, and the
record is only written once the label mutation actually applied.

Everything the command says about providers comes from a single
:class:`ProviderImpactAssessment`: one bounded, point-in-time read of every
provider the issue depends on, taken at one instant. The label decision, the
retry metadata, and the user-facing history text are all derived from that same
assessment, so they cannot drift apart or describe different moments (#5980
F4/A2).
