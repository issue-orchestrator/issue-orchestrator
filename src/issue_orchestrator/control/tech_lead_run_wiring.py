"""Wiring the tech-lead run owner into each host that requests a run (#6994).

The admission policy has ONE implementation
(:class:`..control.tech_lead_run_admission.TechLeadRunCoordinator`), but three
very differently-shaped callers reach it: the orchestrator facade (which holds a
dependency container), the in-tick action applier (which does not hold the
facade but does hold every input it needs), and the CLI. Left in the policy
module, that plumbing crowded out the policy; spelled out at each call site, it
would have every entrypoint knowing which six internals a coordinator needs.

So this module owns composition and nothing else: the shared anchor-lifecycle
adapter, one structural protocol per host shape, and the single factory that
wires the real owners — anchor discovery from the health-review trigger,
blocking classification from :class:`LabelManager` — so no call site
re-implements either rule.
