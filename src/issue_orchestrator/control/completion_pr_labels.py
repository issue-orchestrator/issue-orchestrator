"""What an agent may ask to have labelled on its own PR (#6999 F2).

``pr_labels`` is the one label set that arrives from OUTSIDE the orchestrator's
own planning: an agent writes it into its completion record and the processor
applies it. That makes it untrusted input, and the shared ``needs-human`` block
is not among the things it may hand itself. Applied there it would create a
block with no cause recorded against it, which a later typed release then takes
away from whoever DID record one - the exact loss the shared-block owner exists
to prevent. The agent already has the typed ``needs_human`` completion outcome
for this, and that one goes through the owner.

The rule is enforced twice, on purpose, and neither is redundant:

* at the DOOR, by :func:`reserved_pr_label_error`, which rejects the whole
  completion record before any side effect - no push, no PR, no labels;
* at the WRITE, by the governed label capability, which refuses the value.

They consult different objects (the block owner, then the label capability), so
a composition can wire one without the other. When that happens the write-side
refusal FAILS the completion rather than skipping the entry: a request for a
human block that is silently dropped is one nothing downstream can see.
