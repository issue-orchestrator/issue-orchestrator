"""Worker-slot accounting — the single owner of "which active sessions count
against the worker budget (``max_concurrent_sessions``)".

Every worker-capacity consumer must agree on this rule or they drift
(cross-path rule drift):

* the planner computes remaining capacity and explains capacity skips,
* startup recovery decides whether partial worker sessions may resume, and
* the orchestrator's E2E start-gate asks whether a first-class E2E run may
  claim a worker slot.

The rule: the tech lead draws from its own reserved additive budget
when ``tech_lead.max_concurrent`` is set, so its active sessions are NOT charged
to the worker budget; otherwise (the shared-budget default) every active
session counts. E2E, by contrast, is a WORKER workload — it is accounted here,
against ``max_concurrent_sessions``, never against the tech_lead reserved slot.
