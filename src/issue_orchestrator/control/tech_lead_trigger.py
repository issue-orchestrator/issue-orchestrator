"""On-demand tech_lead dispatch — the tech lead, aimed by hand (ADR-0031).

The reactive tech_lead triggers all *discover* the issue to investigate from the
board: the stuck-sweep backstop (:mod:`.stuck_sweep`), the per-failure reaction
model (:mod:`.tech_lead_reaction`), and the periodic / problem-storm health
review. This owner is their manual counterpart — an operator names one or more
specific issues and the tech lead (a ``failure_investigation``) is dispatched
at each, on demand.

It reuses the REAL tech-lead-launch machinery
(``orchestrator.launch_tech_lead_session``) so evidence-map staging, authority
recording, and agent sandboxing are byte-for-byte identical to a reactive
launch: this module builds the same :class:`PendingTechLeadReview` a discovered
failure would and hands it to the same facade method. It then drives the
launched session to completion with the planner PAUSED, so no OTHER board work
starts while the investigation runs — a paused planner returns an empty plan,
yet ``tick()`` still drives already-active sessions to completion and drains
background completion jobs. Completion is applied under ``tech_lead.authority``
exactly as usual, so ``propose``-gated actions stay gated (an ``--advise-only``
run pins every dial to ``propose``).

Boundaries kept deliberately narrow:

* **Owner only.** No CLI / argparse here — the entrypoint injects the clock and
  sleep and prints the results.
* **Injected time.** ``now`` / ``sleep`` are passed in so the drive loop is
  deterministic under test; this owner never touches ``time`` directly.
* **Reuse, don't reimplement.** The failure fact is modelled on
  :func:`.stuck_sweep._recovered_failure` (``timed_out`` reason so the reaction
  model always INVESTIGATES a leaf issue); the launch goes through the one
  facade method the planner already uses.
