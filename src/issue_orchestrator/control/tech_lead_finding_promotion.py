"""Finding promotion: pattern case file -> gated runnable issue (#6957).

``flag_pattern`` case files (#6781) accrue evidence but had no actuation lane;
``tech_lead_shipped_fixes`` has never had a row. This module is the SINGLE
policy owner for the lane that connects them, mirroring
``tech_lead_proposals`` (#6778) piece for piece:

* **Eligibility** — :func:`select_promotable_findings` is pure policy over the
  durable ledgers (zero GitHub reads): a signature is promotable when the lane
  is enabled, it has crossed ``min_evidence`` observations, the tech lead
  classified it ``fix:code``, it has no promotion row yet (promoted, declined,
  or shipped — all three block re-filing), and its ROUTED target repo has cap
  room. Excess eligible signatures simply wait for the next tick; the cap is
  storm backpressure, not a queue.
* **Routing** — the ``tech_lead.findings.route`` table maps an area to the
  target that owns the fix, and :func:`resolve_promotion_route` turns an entry
  into a :class:`PromotionRoute`: the repo AND its scheduling contract. That
  contract is what makes a promotion RUNNABLE — the managed repo's discovery
  queries ``filtering.label`` alongside the agent label, so a self-routed
  promotion inherits both and removing the gate really is the operator's whole
  approval. Self-routed promotions are otherwise ordinary issues in the source
  repo and face its own gates; promotion never bypasses them.
* **Composition** — :func:`build_promotion_issue_body` renders the case file's
  mechanism into human documentation ONLY. The ledger is the authority; editing
  the promoted issue has zero effect on it (the same tamper boundary op
  proposals and case files carry).
* **Filing boundary** — :func:`apply_promote_tech_lead_finding` is the ONE
  mutating boundary. It files the issue through the ``PromotionTargetHost``
  port, then records the ledger row create-once; a filing that raises leaves
  the ledger untouched so the next tick retries, and a recorded row can never
  file a second issue.
* **Loop closure** — :class:`PromotionReadBudget` decides WHICH in-flight
  promotions are polled this tick (at most ``max_open_promoted`` per target,
  rotating), :func:`classify_promotion_outcomes` turns those target-repo reads
  into typed :class:`SettledPromotion` facts (read-only), and
  :func:`apply_settle_tech_lead_promotion` performs the writes. Both terminal
  outcomes RETIRE the case file through the single
  :class:`~.tech_lead_case_file_lifecycle.PatternCaseFileLifecycleOwner`
  (evidence comment, then close): a close whose CLOSING pull request merged
  also records the ``tech_lead_shipped_fixes`` row and retires as ``shipped``;
  any other close is the operator declining, which marks the signature declined
  forever and retires as ``declined`` (#7240). Retirement closes the GitHub
  issue only — the registry keeps the signature, its canonical case file, and
  its evidence, so later observations still append there and never file a
  replacement.

Promotion FILES issues, full stop. Nothing here approves, merges, labels, or
executes anything in the target repo — the target's own orchestrator runs the
work under all of its existing gates.
