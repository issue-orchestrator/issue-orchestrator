"""Triage session completion planning (ADR-0031).

Single home for what happens when a triage session ends: launch-authority
verification, assignment-driven label policy, and decision-artifact
processing. Extracted from ``completion_action_planner`` so the triage owner
boundary (``triage_session_policy`` / ``TriageLaunchAuthority`` on the
launch side, this module on the completion side) lives in one cohesive seam.

Policy summary:

* The ONLY trusted launch scope is the orchestrator-owned
  :class:`TriageLaunchAuthority` recorded at launch (outside the
  agent-writable worktree). The worktree copies (triage-assignment.json,
  manifest.json) are the agent's reading material; a missing authority
  record, or worktree copies that no longer match it, is a critical failure
  (#6761 re-review finding 1) — never a fail-safe success.
* Only batch-review sessions label PRs (the authority manifest set they were
  launched to audit); failure investigations and health reviews never touch
  manifest labels (#6768 B4 / ADR-0031 §4).
* Every COMPLETED triage session (any flavor) must produce a valid
  decision artifact pair — a missing/invalid pair is a contract violation.
  The authoritative classification runs in the completion processing path's
  PRE-ACTION policy phase (``triage_decision_processing_error``, called by
  ``completion_processor`` before any requested push/PR/comment executes —
  #6769 finding 1) so a rejected completion produces zero GitHub effects and
  the session's history outcome is FAILED, not a quiet success; the action
  planner re-reads the same validation for its planning effects (#6761
  finding 3).
* Decision proposals may only target the session's immutable launch scope:
  a failure investigation targets its focus issue only; a health review
  targets its anchor issue only (the report's home, ADR-0031 §4); a batch
  review targets manifest PRs plus the anchor tracking issue
  (``create_issue``/``flag_pattern`` are scope-free — that is where a health
  review's board-wide findings land) — out-of-scope targets are contract
  violations (#6761 re-review finding 2). A failure investigation must
  additionally publish its diagnosis: >=1 ``post_comment`` targeting the
  focus issue (#6761 finding 2).
* Health reviews close their anchor issue on success: the anchor is a
  walk-the-floor log entry, closed when the review lands. A rejected or
  missing pair leaves the anchor open for operator visibility; a
  FAILED/TIMED_OUT health session closes it through the terminal-failure
  path (like batch, no manifest labels) so the next interval re-fires
  instead of deduping against a dead anchor.
* ``create_issue`` proposals may not carry protected workflow labels
  (``triage_issue_policy`` owns the protected set, case-insensitively) —
  contract violation (#6761 finding 4).
