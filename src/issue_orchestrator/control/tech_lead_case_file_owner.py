"""The bounded owner of pattern case-file identity and evidence (#6781/#6957).

A case file is the durable evidence ledger for one pattern signature, and three
invariants make it trustworthy:

* **At most one case file per signature, ever.** Promotion reads the accrued
  observation count, so a second case file would split the evidence that gates
  it — or orphan half of it.
* **Every observation counted exactly once**, under its own identity. The count
  is orchestrator-owned precisely so it cannot be inflated by editing the issue,
  and it must not be inflated by the orchestrator's own retries either.
* **The recorded classification is what the recorded body says.** ``fix_class``
  and ``area`` decide whether a finding is promotable at all and which repo it
  routes to, so they must come from the command that actually wrote the issue.

All three span an authority-store write AND a GitHub write, in an order that
matters, and this module is the owner of that transaction.

**The creation transaction.** The GitHub issue is created before its ledger row
exists, so a crash in between leaves an issue nothing knows about. A marker
lookup can find that issue again — but it cannot say WHICH command wrote it, and
the retry is not guaranteed to be the same command: an ordinary case-file
finalization failure is returned as an ``ActionResult`` failure, so the next
observation of that signature can be the one that recovers it. Adopting the
orphan with the retrying action's metadata therefore recorded the wrong
observation identity and could rewrite a ``fix:human`` finding as ``fix:code``,
with no durable row for the classification preflight to defend (#6957 round-3
review F10). So the owner writes a durable :class:`PendingCaseFile` BEFORE the
create and finalizes a recovered issue FROM THAT INTENT; the retrying action is
then handled separately, as an ordinary append.

Four operations, one owner:

* :meth:`PatternCaseFileOwner.resolve` — typed :class:`CaseFileResolution`:
  already committed, recovered from its intent just now, or absent (create it).
* :meth:`PatternCaseFileOwner.begin` — record the creation intent; call
  immediately before the GitHub create.
* :meth:`PatternCaseFileOwner.open` — commit the ledger row for an issue this
  process just created, and append the rest of its decision's observations.
* :meth:`PatternCaseFileOwner.adopt` / :meth:`append_observations` — reconcile
  an action's observations onto an existing case file.
