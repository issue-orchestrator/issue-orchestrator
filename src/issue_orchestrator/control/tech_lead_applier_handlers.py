"""Apply-time dispatch table for every tech-lead action type.

The tech-lead surface now spans issue creation (#6761/#6778/#6781), act-level
op execution (#6764/#6778), ledger cleanup (#6779), and the finding-promotion
lane (#6957). Each has its own extracted apply-time owner, and the applier's
job for all of them is identical: hand the action to that owner with the ports
it needs. Assembling that mapping here keeps the applier's dispatch table a
single entry, and keeps "which owner runs which tech-lead action" in one place
instead of scattered across the table.

The applier still owns the four handlers that need its own collaborators
(sessions, events, expedite lane); they are passed in rather than reached for.

It also still owns MUTATION POLICY. Every action carries an optional
``ExpectedState``, and ``ActionApplier`` enforces it as a hard optimistic-
concurrency gate before it writes — but a handler that reaches its owner
directly never crosses that gate, so ``Action.expected`` silently meant nothing
on this dispatch branch. A case file paused behind ``io:needs-reconcile`` could
still have a promotion issue filed against it, receive evidence comments, or be
settled (#6957 round-5 review F15/A6).

The first fix wrapped the four commands whose subjects the registry happened to
spell out by hand — and issue CREATION, which is the largest mutation of the
lot (a remote issue, its labels, a ledger row, and anchor comments), kept
sailing past the gate because nobody added it to that list (#6957 round-6
review F3/A3). A hand-maintained subject table is the defect, not the omission.

So the subject is now part of each command's own contract
(:class:`~.tech_lead_actions.TechLeadMutation`), and :func:`_guarded` is applied
to the COMPLETE mutating set — mechanically, from
``TECH_LEAD_MUTATING_ACTION_TYPES``, with a registry-shape guardrail proving no
tech-lead action type can be added to the table on either side by accident. A
mutating command that names no subject may not carry an ``ExpectedState``
either; that combination is a composition bug and fails closed rather than
writing unguarded.

    The gate raises (``ReconciliationRequired``) rather than returning, so a
    paused issue produces zero writes: no target-host call, no repository-host
    call, no authority-store row.

    A command with no subject is allowed through ONLY when it also carries no
    expectations — the two creations that author an anchor issue, and the
    ledger-only discard. A command that states expectations it has nothing to
    check them against is refused before any write: that pairing means the
    subject was dropped somewhere in composition, and running it unguarded is
    exactly the bug this wrapper exists to make impossible.

    This registry-level check is a BACKSTOP, not the primary defence. The
    creation commands now make the invalid state unrepresentable at
    construction (``TechLeadCreationOrigin``, #6957 round-2 review F6/A6),
    because a wrapper that only rejects "expectations without a subject" still
    waves through a follow-up whose subject AND expectations were both dropped —
    it looks exactly like legitimate anchor authoring from here. Commands that
    have no such value object (the ledger-only discard) are still covered here.
