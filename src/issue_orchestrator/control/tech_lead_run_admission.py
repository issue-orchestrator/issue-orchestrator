"""Scoped admission for tech-lead runs — the one owner of run identity (#6994).

Every tech-lead run is requested by SOMEONE: the reactive failure model, the
periodic/storm health-review trigger, the stuck sweep, the one-shot CLI, and
(from #6994) the repository dashboard. Before this module each of those paths
carried its own slice of "may this run start?" — the reaction model deduped
against the pending queue, the workflow owned paused/capacity, the on-demand
trigger owned nothing at all — so the same logical run could be admitted twice
by two different paths and nothing owned the relationship BETWEEN runs.

This module is that missing owner. The run vocabulary it decides over — the two
scopes, the request, the trigger, and the typed outcome — lives in
:mod:`...domain.tech_lead_run`, so an entrypoint or a view model can speak about
runs without importing this policy. What lives HERE is the policy itself.

One request, one verdict:

* :meth:`TechLeadRunCoordinator.admit` answers a REQUEST — identity/dedup,
  eligibility revalidation, cross-instance claim conflict, and enqueue — and
  returns a typed :class:`TechLeadRunAdmission` the caller reports verbatim.
* :mod:`.tech_lead_launch_planning` answers the TICK's question — which queued
  runs may launch right now, and which are no longer worth launching at all.

Deliberate boundaries:

* **Capacity is not re-decided here.** ``tech_lead_slot_availability`` remains
  the single owner of the numeric budget; this owner decides only SEMANTIC
  conflicts, so the two cannot drift.
* **Shared truth, not process-local truth.** Before a request is answered
  ``queued``, this owner ATOMICALLY takes the logical run through
  :class:`.tech_lead_run_ownership.TechLeadRunOwnership` (ADR-0033 compare-and-
  swap, keyed by ``run_key``). Reading shared state and then appending locally
  is a check-then-act gap two engines can both pass, which is how the same run
  used to be admitted twice and both callers told "queued" (#6994 round 1 F1).
  Ownership is taken BEFORE the health-review anchor is created, so the
  scan-then-create gap closes with it.
* **No launching.** Admission ENQUEUES; the planner still launches, so a manual
  request rides the identical evidence/authority path an automatic one does.
