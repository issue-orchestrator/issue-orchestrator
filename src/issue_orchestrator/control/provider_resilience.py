        how long the circuit stays open, and which events describe it. No
        launcher or watcher computes circuit state (#6999).

        ``sample_id`` identifies the *physical* probe result the outcome came

        state, no counter movement, no event. An empty ``sample_id`` means "not
        from a probe" (e.g. a live session's own death) and is always counted.

        An expired credential is human-fixable, so the auth cooldown is its own
