"""Ownership of the orchestrator's in-memory pending queues.

Separated from launch routing (#6999 A2 round 1) because they are different
jobs: routing decides how one launch outcome settles, while this module owns
what may enter and leave each queue at all. Producers say WHICH variant they
are queueing and this owner constructs the item, applies the one deduplication
rule, and returns a typed outcome - they never touch the state lists.

Admission is the other half of the same ownership: a request that comes back
from a dead session re-enters through the very table that says how each queue
removes an item, so a queue's duplicate rule lives in exactly one place whether
the item arrives from discovery or from a provider-deferred relaunch.
