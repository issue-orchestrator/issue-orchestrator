    Proposals are defined by their approval LABELS (#7763), so the only
    complete observation of them is a query for each: the provenance label
    (the unapproved backlog AND the approved items the approval owner must
    verify — a claimed approval, or an admitted follow-up still being worked)
    and the waiting label (a proposal whose provenance label was stripped).
    The two answers are unioned by issue number. Everything the tick already
    holds is a query for something else that merely overlaps:

    - the worker board is narrowed by configured agents, milestones, exclusion
      filters and a fetch limit — it fetches runnable work, not approvals;
    - the anchor scan queries the TECH-LEAD agent label, while a promoted
      finding carries the TARGET'S worker agent label so it is
      "DISCOVERABLE the moment the gate comes off"
      (:func:`~.tech_lead_finding_promotion.promotion_issue_labels`) — and is
      therefore structurally invisible to an agent-scoped scan.

    Joining those two does not produce a complete set; it produces two
    incomplete ones. This costs one labelled query on ticks that already do
    tech-lead work, and it is what lets the board be written straight from
    the facts: a complete observation needs no retention, and retention is
    what would let an approved proposal linger (the warning in
    ``_build_view``'s own docstring).

    ``exhaustive`` for the same reason the anchor scan is (#6779 R17): a
    dropped page must RAISE rather than return a silently partial set a caller
    would read as "fewer approvals pending".
