"""Periodic health-review trigger (ADR-0031 §4).

Single owner for the trigger side of the health-review lifecycle:

- **anchor discovery**: the scoped, exhaustive open-anchor scans shared by
  fact gathering and startup recovery (one eligibility rule for both paths),
  plus the marker-scoped dedup lookup (the ``HEALTH_REVIEW_MARKER_LABEL`` is
  the crash-safe dedup key, ADR-0013);
- **due policy**: the interval math against ``state.last_health_review_at``
  AND a board-change gate — the review fires only when the reviewable board
  differs from the fingerprint recorded at the last review, so an idle
  orchestrator never re-walks an unchanged board (the storm trigger is exempt);
- **planning**: the anchor-issue creation action when the review is due, no
  open anchor or pending launch already covers it, and the owned
  paused/capacity gate (``TriageWorkflow``) says go — anchor shaping (labels,
  priority title, milestone intent) comes from the ``triage_issue_policy``
  owner, same as batch anchors;
- **intake**: after a successful creation, route the anchor into the pending
  queue through the owning :class:`PendingSessionQueues` operation for the
  variant the marker label declares (batch vs health — #6768 round 3 typed
  intake), and stamp/persist ``state.last_health_review_at`` so neither the
  next tick nor a restart double-fires. A problem-storm anchor additionally
  records its cohort in the durable ledger (``TriageAuthorityStore``) BEFORE
  collapsing the superseded per-issue investigations — the collapse is
  earned by persistence, never assumed (#6780);
- **restart reconciliation**: hydrate ``last_health_review_at`` from the
  durable store AND the newest marker-labeled anchor issue — the issues are
  the crash-safe truth (ADR-0013), so a store persist failure can never
  re-fire the review before the interval elapses. A recovered storm anchor
  also rehydrates its cohort from the ledger: labels prove the anchor
  EXISTS, but they cannot carry which problems it owns (#6780).

The anchor issue then rides the existing batch-issue lifecycle: it is picked
up like any triage-agent issue, the launcher derives the HEALTH_REVIEW flavor
from the marker label, and completion closes the anchor when a valid decision
pair lands (see ``triage_session_policy`` / ``triage_completion``).
