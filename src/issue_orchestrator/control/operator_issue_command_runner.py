"""The one implementation of an operator retry/dismiss transition (#6999 F5/A2).

Both commands are the same shape: settle the LABELS first, and only if that
committed, settle the LOCAL STATE. The order is the whole point. Local retry
gates - ``session_history``, ``failed_this_cycle``, the queue cache - are what
stop the planner relaunching into an issue, so clearing them while GitHub still
carries a blocking label makes the planner walk straight back into it. The
reverse mistake is just as bad: an operator told "queued for retry" whose issue
never becomes eligible, because the label came off and the gate did not.

Retry and dismiss differ in exactly two ways, and both are named here rather
than reconstructed by a caller:

* WHICH labels each clears (:class:`~.operator_unblock.OperatorUnblocker`);
* WHAT settling means afterwards - retry makes the issue eligible again and
  refreshes the cached copy, dismiss removes it from the board entirely.

Everything between those two - what counts as committed, what a refusal means,
what a failed write means - runs through ONE method, because the last time the
two paths spelled it out separately dismiss quietly lost a branch of it twice:
first the shared-block refusal (#6999 F3), then the failed ordinary write
(#6999 F5 round 7). A difference that is not one of the two named above is a
bug, so there is no longer anywhere to write one.

        Removing the GitHub label is not enough: ``QueueCache.evaluate_issue``
        rejects any issue whose number is in ``session_history`` (or
        ``failed_this_cycle``), so the planner keeps skipping it on every
        refresh until the orchestrator restarts. And clearing those gates is not
        enough either, because ``Scheduler`` re-reads the cached issue's LABELS
        and refuses anything still wearing a blocking one.

        So the cached copy is reconciled against what GitHub actually had, not
        patched with this attempt's removals (#6999 F7 round 8). The difference
        only shows up across two attempts, which is exactly what the new partial
        failure path made reachable:

        1. the cache and GitHub both carry ``blocked`` and ``blocked-failed``;
        2. a first retry removes ``blocked``, fails on ``blocked-failed``, and
           correctly leaves the cache alone;
        3. the operator retries. The fresh read now shows only
           ``blocked-failed``, so that is all this attempt removes.

        Subtracting only step 3's removals from the step-1 cache leaves
        ``blocked`` on the cached copy - already gone from GitHub, still gating
        the planner - and the operator is told the issue was queued. Starting
        from ``observed``, the pre-write snapshot this attempt actually acted
        on, cannot drift that way: it is authoritative for every label,
