"""Which logical tech-lead runs THIS engine owns, across instances (#6994).

The admission matrix in :mod:`.tech_lead_run_admission` decides whether a run
*should* exist. This module decides whether this engine *may own* it, and — the
part a second Repository Engine makes non-trivial — whether it may EXECUTE it
right now.

Why it is a separate owner from the coordinator: the coordinator is constructed
per request from live state and holds nothing, whereas ownership is exactly the
thing that must OUTLIVE a request (a run is owned from admission, through the
ticks it waits behind a barrier, until its session ends). Folding the two
together would either give the coordinator a lifetime it must not have, or push
lease bookkeeping out to every call site.

Four operations, and the invariant each preserves:

* :meth:`TechLeadRunOwnership.claim` — atomic reservation of a run identity.
  Exactly one engine wins a given ``run_key``; the loser is told WHO won. This
  closes the two check-then-act gaps admission cannot close locally: "no anchor
  exists, so create one" and "no local queue entry exists, so enqueue one".
* :meth:`TechLeadRunOwnership.begin_run` — the atomic EXCLUSIVITY decision, made
  at the moment a session would start. Reserving a run never consults the
  barrier (queuing behind a global review is the designed behaviour); starting
  one always does, against every engine's live runs at once. Composing
  independent per-key claims could never decide this, which is why the shared
  store is a ledger (round 2 F1/A1).
* :meth:`TechLeadRunOwnership.reconcile` — one call per tick that renews every
  live run's lease, drops ownership of runs that ended, and re-establishes
  ownership of runs recovered from shared truth after a restart. It reports a
  TYPED outcome per run, because "a peer holds it", "we held it and lost it",
  and "we could not tell" demand three different behaviours from the caller
  (round 2 F4).
* :meth:`TechLeadRunOwnership.release` — explicit hand-back when a run is
  withdrawn or completes, so a peer need not wait out the lease.

Leases are tracked in memory as well as in the store so the renewal decision
costs no GitHub read: reservation already told us when the lease expires, and
re-reading it every tick to discover that would be exactly the polling the
project's GitHub API discipline forbids.
