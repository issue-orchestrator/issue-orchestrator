"""Tech-lead attention sweep for terminally-stuck issues (#6823).

Single policy owner for the reactive backstop that the normal control loop
cannot reach: an open issue that carries a terminal blocking label but is NOT
in any active session, pending tech_lead queue, or storm cohort has fallen out of
the loop entirely — no completion will ever re-discover it, so it sits stuck
forever. This module finds those issues on a bounded, timer-gated cadence and
re-injects each one into the EXISTING reactive-tech-lead pipeline as a recovered
:class:`DiscoveredFailure`, so the tech-lead reaction model investigates it and
the tech lead agent proposes/executes ``reset_retry`` (or closes it if the work is
actually done).

Design boundaries (kept deliberately narrow, ADR-0031):

* **All policy lives here.** The planner, ``fact_gatherer`` and
  ``tech_lead_reaction`` gain no new branchy control vocabulary — the fact
  gatherer only arms this owner and records what it returns.
* **Observation, not mutation.** :func:`run_stuck_sweep` reads GitHub and
  mutates only orchestrator STATE (the durable per-issue recovery counter, the
  injected discovered failures, and the escalation buffer). It never writes a
  GitHub label directly — recovered failures ride the Observer -> Planner ->
  Applier chain, and exhausted issues are escalated to needs-human through the
  Planner/Applier too (#6824 F1), so every GitHub write stays orchestrator-
  authoritative.
* **Budget spent on OUTCOMES, not injections (#6824 F1).** The durable per-issue
  counter (:attr:`OrchestratorState.recovery_attempts`) counts *failed recovery
  cycles*, not re-injections. First detection injects and records ``0`` (an
  outstanding recovery, no failure yet); a LATER sweep that re-discovers the
  same issue still stuck and NOT owned means the prior cycle's remedy did not
  stick — that is the failure that spends one unit of budget. Once the budget is
  exhausted the issue is escalated to needs-human ONCE and never re-injected; a
  genuine recovery (the blocking label cleared) clears the counter so a later
  unrelated incident starts fresh.
* **``failure_reason`` is always ``timed_out``.** The reaction model's
  ``_disposition`` only applies the "no downstream dependents -> IGNORE" gate
  when ``failure_reason == "blocked"``; ``timed_out`` always yields
  INVESTIGATE. The recovered failure preserves the issue's REAL terminal label
  in ``blocking_label`` for context, but reports ``timed_out`` so a leaf stuck
  issue is still investigated rather than silently dropped.
* **Ownership vs eligibility (#6824 F2).** An issue is ELIGIBLE when it carries a
  recoverable stuck label — including ``blocked:provider-unavailable`` and the
  needs-human labels, which #6823 wants re-examined, not permanently ignored. It
  is SKIPPED this sweep only while a dedicated owner is actively handling it: an
  active session / pending tech_lead work, an open gated proposal (the ledger), a
  provider whose circuit is still open (the resilience manager will resume it),
  or a ``tech-lead-needs-human`` marker (the escalation reconciler owns it). Only
  ``proposed-tech-lead`` / ``tech-lead-observation`` are true machinery labels never
  treated as work items.
