"""CleanupManager - handles worktree and session cleanup.

This module extracts cleanup logic from the orchestrator:
1. process_deferred_cleanups - Clean up after reviews complete
2. recover_orphaned_cleanups - Clean up orphaned worktrees on startup

Cleanup is deferred when:
- Triage workflow: wait for triage-reviewed label
- Code review workflow: wait for code-reviewed label
