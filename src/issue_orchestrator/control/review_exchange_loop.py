"""Atomic-write tempfile sweep for the review-exchange ``summary.json``.

This module previously hosted the spawn-per-phase exchange runner that
``CompletionReviewExchange`` dispatched to. The persistent-session
runner in ``execution.persistent_session_exchange`` replaced that loop,
and its tests + integration coverage replaced this module's test
surface. The shared protocol types/builders/parsers live in
``domain.review_exchange``; the atomic-write helper lives in
``infra.atomic_io``. What's left here is the orchestrator-startup
sweep that cleans up tempfiles orphaned by a hard ``kill -9``.
