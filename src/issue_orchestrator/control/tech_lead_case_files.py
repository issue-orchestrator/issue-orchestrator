"""Pattern case-file issues: the durable flag_pattern ledger (#6781).

``flag_pattern`` used to produce an event and a report line — observed
patterns evaporated unless someone read that session's report. Under execute
authority it now creates or appends to a **case-file issue** keyed by pattern
signature, so the tech-lead model gets an accumulating problem ledger the
operator can read on GitHub. This module is the single policy owner for the
case-file lifecycle, mirroring ``tech_lead_proposals`` (#6778) piece for piece:

* **Composition** — :func:`build_case_file_issue_action` turns the first
  observation of a signature into a :class:`CreateTechLeadCaseFileIssueAction`.
  The issue body is human documentation ONLY: dedup consults the ledger, so
  editing the issue after creation has zero effect (the tamper boundary).
* **Creation boundary** — the applier's single create-issue executor
  (``tech_lead_issue_creation.apply_create_tech_lead_issue``) records the
  ``(signature -> issue)`` ledger row create-once when it creates the issue.
* **Ledger dedup** — one case file per signature:
  :func:`build_pattern_ledger` projects the store's rows; a repeat
  observation plans an :class:`AddCommentAction` carrying the new evidence
  (:func:`build_case_file_evidence_comment`) instead of a second issue.
* **Classification** — :func:`split_tech_lead_case_file_issues` partitions the
  fact gatherer's ONE open-issue anchor scan (no extra GitHub call):
  observation-labeled issues become :class:`TechLeadCaseFileSummary` facts for
  the board snapshot and can never be mistaken for batch/health anchors.
  Startup recovery uses the same split so a case file is never requeued as
  an anchor.
* **No terminal handling** — observations are not ops; there is nothing to
  execute or discard. Graduation is native: a firmed-up pattern gets a
  linked root-cause work issue, evidence trail intact.
