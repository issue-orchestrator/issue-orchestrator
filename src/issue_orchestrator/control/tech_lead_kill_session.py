"""Execution-time owner for tech_lead ``kill_hung_session`` ops.

The action may come directly from ``execute`` authority or from an approved
gated proposal (#6778). It is a stale-checkable fact recorded against the board
the proposing session observed. The injected termination owner re-validates
and mutates that same typed generation in one boundary:

1. the target issue must STILL have an active session — the entire point of
   the op is terminating live-but-stuck work, so a session that already
   exited (completed, crashed, was reset) makes the proposal stale.

On a stale precondition the op DOWNGRADES exactly like ``reset_retry``:
``publish_proposal_surfaced`` emits ``TECH_LEAD_ACTION_PROPOSED`` with
``mode="stale_downgrade"`` and no mutations are posted (the applier's
finalizer then closes the proposal issue with a "preconditions no longer
hold" comment). On success a ``TECH_LEAD_ACTION_EXECUTED`` event records the
termination boundary effects. Kill-owner failures fail the action loudly.

The termination itself is NOT reimplemented here: ``run_kill`` is the
generation-aware production boundary. It conditionally stops the exact
terminal/run pair and tears down its issue-scoped hidden owners, WITHOUT the
reset (no PR superseding, label/history clearing, or relaunch). Production
wiring lives in ``entrypoints/tech_lead_reset_retry_wiring.py``.
