"""Canonical event name catalog.

This module defines all stable event names that can be consumed by UI, tests,
and external systems. Event names follow the format: {domain}.{action_past_tense}

Domains:
- orchestrator: Lifecycle (started, ready, idle, paused, resumed, shutdown_*)
- tick: Per-cycle boundaries (started, completed)
- facts: Discovery phase (gathered)
- plan: Planning phase (computed, noop)
- apply: Action execution (started, step_applied, completed, failed)
- session: Agent session lifecycle (started, observed, completed, failed)
- agent: User-facing agent lifecycle projections (coding_completed)
- issue: Issue state changes (blocked, needs_human)
- dependency: Issue dependencies (blocked, unblocked)
- review: Code review workflow (started, queued, escalated)
- rework: Rework cycle (started)
- tech_lead: Tech Lead workflow (issue_created)
- cleanup: Cleanup operations (completed)
- validation: Local validation hooks (started, completed)
- config: Configuration events (merged)

All events emitted by the orchestrator MUST use EventName constants.
Raw strings are not accepted by TraceEvent.

    Membership is enforced by `tests/unit/test_event_spec.py`, which
