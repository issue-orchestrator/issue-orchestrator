"""Durable schema for the tech_lead authority store, and its migrations.

Split from the adapter because it is a distinct concern with a distinct
lifetime: the adapter's methods describe how the orchestrator READS AND WRITES
its ledgers today, while this file is the accumulating record of every shape
those ledgers have ever had. The two change for unrelated reasons — a new
column here, a new query there — and keeping them together made the adapter
grow past its hotspot budget for reasons that had nothing to do with its
behavior.

One entry point: :func:`initialize_tech_lead_authority_schema` creates whatever
is missing and backfills whatever an older database is short of.
