"""Shared atomic-write toolkit for run-scoped artifacts.

Multiple writers (the persistent-session review-exchange runner, the
orchestrator-startup tempfile sweep, the legacy synchronous publisher)
need to write artifacts atomically so concurrent readers — most
notably the main orchestrator tick polling ``summary.json`` — never
observe a partially written file. Centralizing the helper here avoids
duplicating the temp-file pattern across modules and gives the sweep
one canonical prefix/suffix to scan for.
