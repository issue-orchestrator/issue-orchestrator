"""When is the finding-promotion lane active, and is it ready? (#6957)

Four boundaries need this answer and had each encoded their own version of it,
which is how a configuration could pass validation AND doctor and then raise on
a normal tick (#6957 round-2 review F9/A4):

* configuration validation — "is this config startable?"
* doctor — "which route targets must be proven writable before startup?"
* fact gathering — "should this tick read the ledgers and poll targets at all?"
* route resolution — "which repo and scheduling labels does this area map to?"

This module is the single owner. Everything else consumes
:func:`promotion_lane_readiness` and never re-derives the predicate.

**Activation.** The lane is ACTIVE only when the master tech-lead workflow is
enabled, the promotion mode is not ``off``, and a repository is configured.
The master predicate includes the configured-agent dependency and preserves the
legacy agent-presence rule when ``tech_lead.enabled`` is omitted. Turning the
master switch off stops the whole ADR-0031 machinery — including cross-repo
loop-closure reads. Durable promotion rows are never discarded, so re-enabling
resumes settlement exactly where it stopped.

**Readiness.** An ACTIVE lane's remaining dependencies are startup errors, not
tick-time exceptions: any route that resolves through the managed repo's own
worker agent requires ``review.tech_lead_follow_up_agent``, and every foreign
target must be proven writable before startup.

The module is deliberately a pure function of ``Config`` — no ports, no GitHub —
so validation, doctor, and the control plane can all consume it without either
layer importing the other.
