"""Tech Lead workflow label + promotion-route checks for doctor.

When tech_lead is configured, act-level proposals are filed as GitHub issues
carrying the ``proposed-tech-lead`` gate (#6779 R3). A fresh install that never
provisioned that label would create ungated (schedulable) proposal issues, so
surface the missing gate here in addition to the applier's fail-before-create
guard.

The finding-promotion lane (#6957) adds a second precondition: every configured
``tech_lead.findings.route`` target must be a repo this token can actually file
that route's promotions in — the whole filing contract, labels included, since
``file_issue`` provisions any missing label before it creates the issue. That is
verified here rather than at promotion time, because a promotion fires on the
tick a pattern finally crosses its evidence threshold — discovering a misrouted
target then means losing the actuation the lane exists to provide.

    Only NON-``self`` targets are probed: a ``self`` route lands in the managed

    auth/repo/label checks. One probe per distinct target, and none at all when
    the lane is inactive or every route is ``self`` — GitHub API discipline.

    Neither half of the question is decided here. Activation comes from
    :func:`promotion_lane_readiness`, the same owner configuration validation
    and fact gathering consume — deciding it locally is what let doctor skip
    these probes while the runtime went on promoting anyway (round-2 review F9).
    WHAT must be proven comes from ``promotion_filing_contracts``, built on the
    lane's one route resolver — deriving a weaker permission check locally is
    what let doctor approve a route whose first promotion would die provisioning
    a label (round-6 review F2/A1).

    ``target_host`` is injectable so this check is testable without a live
    GitHub; production leaves it None and the host is built from config.
