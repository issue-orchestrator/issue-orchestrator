"""Attributed shutdown-signal handling.

When an orchestrator dies on a SIGTERM, operators need to know **who** sent it,
not just that one arrived. Python's asyncio ``add_signal_handler`` does not
expose the sender, so a bare ``kill`` from outside the orchestrator system is
unattributable — the handler can only log ``os.getppid()`` (the *parent*), which
is a red herring: the parent is rarely the sender, and blaming it has sent real
investigations down the wrong path.

POSIX *does* report the sender via ``siginfo.si_pid`` — but only through
``sigwaitinfo``/``sigtimedwait``, not through a normal handler. So this module:

1. blocks SIGTERM/SIGINT process-wide (``block_shutdown_signals``, called once at
   the entry point before any threads start, so every thread inherits the block
   and the signals stay pending),
2. starts the consumer immediately (``begin_shutdown_watch``) so the window
   before the event loop exists stays stoppable — a signal there is attributed
   and forces exit rather than hanging until startup completes, and
3. once the loop is live, attaches the graceful callback
   (``install_attributed_shutdown``): the consumer dequeues signals on a
   dedicated thread via ``signal.sigwaitinfo``, logs the real sender pid/uid +
   resolved command line, then runs the caller's shutdown callback on the loop.

On platforms without ``sigwaitinfo``/``pthread_sigmask`` (e.g. Windows) it falls
back to asyncio signal handlers — still honest: the fallback message states the
sender is not reported rather than implying the parent sent it.
