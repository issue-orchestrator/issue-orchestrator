"""Registry for runtime-managed artifact paths.

Two categories of paths that dirty-tree guardrails must ignore:

1. **Runtime metadata** — session logs, caches, UI state under
   ``.issue-orchestrator/`` and ``.claude/``. These are written by the
   orchestrator *and the agent's own session* during normal work and
   never represent user-authored source changes. Filtered in every
   dirty-tree surface regardless of tracked/untracked status.

2. **Orchestrator-planted source** — files the orchestrator copies into
   every worktree at creation time (see
   ``adapters/worktree/_worktree_runtime.sync_cli_tools``). In the
   orchestrator's own repo these files are tracked source (legitimate
   dev edits *must* count as dirty). In a *foreign* target repo the
   same files are untracked plantings that should never register as
   dirty — otherwise every ``coding-done`` call in a foreign worktree
   fails the guard, the agent tries to work around it by editing
   ``.git/info/exclude`` (Claude Code's sensitive-file gate blocks
   interactively), and sessions silently burn 90 minutes to the
   session-level timeout. Filtered **only when untracked** so developer
   modifications in the orchestrator repo still fire the guard.
