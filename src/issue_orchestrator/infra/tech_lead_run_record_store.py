"""SQLite home for the local tech-lead run history (ADR-0033 / #6858).

Its own database file, not another table in ``tech_lead_authority.sqlite``, for
a reason the two lifetimes make plain: the authority store holds LOAD-BEARING
rows — the launch grant completion validates against, the gated ops an approval
executes — and it is a retention owner that deletes them at each run's terminal.
This store holds the opposite: rows that exist only after they stop mattering to
control flow, and whose whole value is that nothing deletes them. Sharing one
file would put an operator's six-week history behind the same schema migrations
and the same corruption blast radius as a trust boundary.

Every write is best-effort, per the port's exception contract: an unwritable
history is a lost receipt, never a reason to fail the run that earned it.
