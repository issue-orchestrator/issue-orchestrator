"""SQLite adapter for the ``TechLeadAuthorityStore`` port.

The agent-writable worktree carries copies of the tech_lead assignment and PR
manifest for the *agent* to read; the orchestrator must never treat those
copies as authority (an agent can rewrite them mid-session — #6761 re-review
finding 1). This adapter persists the :class:`TechLeadLaunchAuthority` recorded
at launch, keyed by session run identity, in the per-repo state directory —
the same orchestrator-owned home as ``queue_cache.sqlite`` /
``label_store.sqlite`` — so it survives restarts. It is constructed ONCE at
the composition root (``entrypoints/bootstrap.py``) and injected behind
``ports/tech_lead_authority.py`` into the launch and completion seams (#6769
finding 2); the database is registered in ``infra/sqlite_registry.py`` for
doctor checks, backups, and startup maintenance (#6769 finding 3).

Why not the existing stores:

* ``QueueCacheStore`` owns the in-scope issue snapshot with replace-all
  semantics (``save_snapshot`` wipes, ``clear()`` resets the warm cache);
  piggybacking launch authority onto its meta table couples two unrelated
  lifecycles and a cache reset would destroy authority mid-session.
* ``JsonSessionStore`` persists best-effort (save errors are swallowed) and
  is reachable only where SessionStore is injected — the completion action
  planner is constructed inside ``completion_handler`` with (config,
  repository_host, label_manager) only, so an injected instance cannot reach
  it; concurrent JSON read-modify-write from launcher + completion would
  also race.
* ``OrchestratorState`` + label recovery is in-memory/label-shaped; labels
  cannot carry a per-run manifest PR set.
