"""Recover an orchestrator-created issue by a body marker (#6957).

Every "create the remote issue, then record the local ledger row" boundary has
the same crash window: the process can die between the two, leaving a real
GitHub issue that no ledger knows about. The next attempt must find that issue
rather than filing a second one — promotion issues are at-most-one per
signature, and so are pattern case files.

This is the ONE recovery policy both boundaries use, so they cannot drift:

* the newest repository issues are read FRESH first, because GitHub's search
  index can lag a successful create by minutes and the crash window is
  precisely "just created";
* title search is the fallback for an older interrupted filing that has fallen
  out of that window;
* ownership is decided by the marker in the BODY, never by a mutable title or
  label, so an edited issue is still recovered and an unrelated issue with a
  similar title never is.

    (``in:title``, capped at 30 results), so an issue that has aged out of the
    window AND had its title edited is invisible here even though its body
    marker is intact (#6957 round-5 review F13).

    Use this only where a miss costs at most a duplicate that some other
    invariant already prevents. Where a negative answer is load-bearing —
    retiring a durable creation intent, deciding a re-routed signature may take
