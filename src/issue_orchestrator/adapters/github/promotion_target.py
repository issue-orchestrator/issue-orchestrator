"""GitHub implementation of the finding-promotion target port (#6957).

The orchestrator's ``GitHubAdapter`` is bound to ONE repo (its caches, label
provisioning, and write verification all assume ``config.repo``), but promotion
routes a finding to the repo that owns the fix — frequently a different one. So
this adapter reuses the adapter's own cross-repo pattern (a short-lived
``GitHubHttpClient`` built from the target repo's configured auth, or the source
auth when no override exists), scoped to the four operations
:class:`PromotionTargetHost` declares and nothing else.

Requests for the adapter's OWN repo are delegated to the bound adapter, so a
self-routed promotion keeps the cache/verification behavior every other write
in that repo gets.
