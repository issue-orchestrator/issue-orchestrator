"""Locating the scheduler's tools, and the one boundary that invokes them.

Every adapter in this package needs the same two things: the absolute
path of a scheduler tool, and a way to run it under the configuration
that lanes are actually submitted to. The executor submits and follows
jobs, the policy check reads the pool's effective configuration, and the
pool inspector reads capacity and queue — so resolution and invocation
belong to the package rather than to whichever adapter happened to need
them first.

The environment rule differs by question, and the asymmetry is the
design: see :meth:`CondorTools.invoke` and
:meth:`CondorTools.read_configuration`. Both take a plain
``timeout_seconds`` rather than a budget object, so the caller that owns
an operation owns how its allowance is divided.

        a cancelling lane's wind-down spends ONE budget across every
