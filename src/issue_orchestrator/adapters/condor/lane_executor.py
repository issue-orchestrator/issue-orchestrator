        The job must not outlive us, its last output belongs in the
        retained directory, and so does its accounting — the removal
        here is exactly what makes the ClassAd appear.

        ONE clock and ONE policy, both from the first instruction (round
        3). Round 2 put the budget and the exception boundary around the
        accounting only, which left the two stages before it — the
        removal and the stream drain — outside both: a slow ``condor_rm``
        spent the general tool timeout on top of the budget, a second
        interrupt during it propagated with no ``__cause__``, and a
        ``SystemExit`` during it replaced the original ending outright.
        A method that owns an operation owns all of it, so the budget is
        created here and every stage below draws from it.

        Nothing this does may rewrite why the lane ended, so ordinary
        failures and ``SystemExit`` are contained — and RECORDED, because
        a containment that reports nothing is indistinguishable from a
        bug. The single exception is the teardown policy: a second
        interrupt arriving during cleanup means the operator is no longer
        willing to wait for it, so it wins over the first — chained,
        never substituted in silence, so the original ending stays
        readable as ``__cause__`` even when both are interrupts.

        "During cleanup" includes RECORDING the cleanup (round 6). That
        stage renders a contained exception, rendering re-raises teardown
        signals rather than eating them, and a signal raised inside one
        handler cannot re-enter its sibling — so the recording carries
        its own copy of the policy. BOTH halves of it (round 7): a
        second interrupt while recording chains, and an ordinary failure
        or ``SystemExit`` from the write itself is contained, because a
        lane that ended on Ctrl-C must not report that it ended on a
        closed stderr. Every stage of this method chains, or none of
        them can be said to.

        And the ending carries the cleanup failure OUT (round 8). Writing
        it to stderr protected the ending but not the evidence: when the
        write failed there was nowhere left to put ``contained``, and it
        vanished. The exception chain is the one carrier that always
        exists, so the ending is re-raised from inside the handler and
        implicit chaining records ``contained`` as its ``__context__`` —
        unconditionally, not only when the report failed, so the
        invariant does not depend on whether stderr happened to work.
        The ORIGINAL is what escapes and its ``__cause__`` stays clear,
        so it is still directly readable as the ending.
