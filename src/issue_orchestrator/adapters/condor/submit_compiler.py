    """Compile the exact argv into a POSIX-sh shim that also measures.

    ``shlex.quote`` escaping survives spaces, quotes, and newlines,
    so the lane runs with byte-exact arguments.

    The shim runs the lane instead of ``exec``-ing it, because a
    process that has replaced itself cannot report anything afterwards
    and the CPU measurement has to come from the shell that waited for
    the lane. Everything else about the shim exists to make that
    invisible:

    - **The lane's exit status is re-raised verbatim**, signal deaths
      (128+N) included.
    - **The lane's stderr is byte-identical.** A surviving shell
      announces its dead child ("Killed: 9") on its own stderr, which
      is the lane's error file — output the lane never produced (B,
      #7136 review). So the real stderr is duplicated to fd 3, the
      shell's own stderr goes to ``/dev/null``, and the lane is
      handed fd 3 as its stderr (closing the spare in the child, so
      the lane inherits no descriptor it did not have before). The
      split is exactly right: a failed ``execve`` is reported by the
      already-redirected CHILD and still reaches the lane's error
      file, while the job-status notice comes from the parent and is
      discarded.
    - **The shim outlives the soft kill; the lane does not have to.**
      This is the subtle one, and it was caught only against a live
      pool. The scheduler's deadline removal sends a soft kill, waits
      out ``job_max_vacate_time``, then hard-kills the job's whole
      family. A plain shell dies instantly on the soft kill, the
      scheduler sees the job's primary process gone, and the hard kill
      that would have reaped a signal-resistant descendant never
      comes — the lane's process tree survives its own deadline. So
      the shim ignores the soft-kill signals and keeps waiting, which
      is exactly the lifetime an ``exec``-ed lane had. The lane must
      NOT inherit that immunity (a lane deserves its chance to shut
      down gracefully), and it does not: ignored dispositions survive
      fork and exec, so the subshell resets them before ``exec``-ing.
      Measured against the live pool: 5/5 containment with this, 1/3
      and 2/3 for shapes without it, 3/3 for the plain ``exec`` shim
      it restores parity with. ``SIGKILL`` is unaffected — it cannot
      be ignored, and needs no help.
    - **The subshell ``exec``s the lane**, so it costs a fork but no
      resident process: the running tree is the shim plus the lane,
      exactly one process more than before.
    - **The whole preamble shares line 2 with the lane's ``exec``.**
      When ``execve`` itself fails — a lane binary that is missing or
      not executable — the shell's diagnostic quotes the script's LINE
      NUMBER (``lane.exec: line 2: ...: Permission denied``, and the
      dash and zsh spellings of the same). Written as separate lines
      the preamble pushed the ``exec`` to line 4 and changed that text,
      which is a difference in the lane's error file however cosmetic
      it looks (B round 2, #7136 review). Semicolons put the redirect,
      the trap, and the ``exec`` on one physical line, so the ``exec``
      sits on line 2 exactly where the pre-measurement shim's did.
      Anything inserted ahead of it re-breaks this, which is why the
      equivalence is pinned by comparing against that earlier shim
      rather than against a copied string.

    The contract this holds, in full: for any lane, the shim's exit
    status, stdout, and stderr are byte-identical to the pre-measurement
    shim's — clean exits, non-zero exits, signal deaths, and lane
    binaries that cannot be executed alike. Verified empirically on
    ``bash`` 3.2 (macOS ``/bin/sh``), ``bash`` 5, ``dash`` (Linux
    ``/bin/sh``), and ``zsh``, along with the lane's signal
    dispositions left at their defaults and the shim surviving a soft
    kill to report its lane's real status.
