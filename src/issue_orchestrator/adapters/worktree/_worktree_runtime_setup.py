"""Owner for the runtime setup sequence applied to orchestrator worktrees.

``_worktree.py`` owns worktree *lifecycle* decisions — reuse this path, rebase
that branch, recreate when validation fails. It must not also own what "ready
for an agent session" means. This module does: it holds the setup steps, their
order, and the failure semantics of each, so a policy change lands in exactly
one place instead of drifting across the three lifecycle paths (fresh create,
reuse by branch, reuse by path) that all need identical setup.
