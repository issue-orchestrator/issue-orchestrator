    Install git hooks into a worktree.

        True when the orchestrator's pre-push guardrail is one Git will
        actually run: the worktree's effective ``core.hooksPath`` is the
        worktree hooks directory, and the orchestrator hook is in it — either
        standalone as ``pre-push`` or as ``pre-push.orchestrator`` behind the
        chained wrapper. False when it is not, for any reason: no linked git
        dir, unreadable repo hook configuration, a worktree Git configuration
        that would not take, or a supplied ``pre_push_hook`` path that does not
        exist. Every False path logs the specific cause.

        Callers that asked for enforced guardrails must treat False as a
        failure. The guardrail is the only thing stopping an agent from pushing
        past validation, so "asked for it", "copied a file" and "Git will run
        it" are three different facts and only the last one is success.

    Note:
        Worktrees have a .git file (not directory) that points to the main repo.
