"""JSONL adapter for the lane dispatch journal.

Owns the storage decisions the port hides: the journal lives beside
the runtime history in the repository's git common dir (shared across
worktrees, like the validation timings), one JSON object per line via
a single O_APPEND write. Shared JSONL publication coordination also keeps
a reader from observing Linux page-wise publication inside that write.

The same class owns reading the file back, because the line format is
one decision and splitting it across a writer and a separate reader is
how the two drift apart.
