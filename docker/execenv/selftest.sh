# In-container proof that the execution environment delivers what it
# exists for (issue #7115, run via `scripts/condor-execenv.sh selftest`):
#
#   1. the pool schedules at all (probe job from a 0700 directory);
#   2. the LaneExecutor contract holds inside the container — including
#      the boundary test's Linux branch: a setsid-detached grandchild
#      is CONTAINED here, the exact guarantee macOS cannot give;
#   3. request_memory is a hard ceiling: the same allocation succeeds
#      under a sufficient budget and dies under an insufficient one, so
#      the limit is the declaration, not the machine.
#
# The repo is mounted read-only at /repo; its Linux venv is built into
# /work/venv (never the repo's own macOS .venv).
