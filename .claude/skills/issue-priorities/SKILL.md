name: issue-priorities
description: Set or change an issue's priority, milestone, or agent assignment so the orchestrator actually picks it up and works it in the intended order. Use when asked to prioritize an issue, queue an issue for an agent, ask why an issue is never picked up, triage a backlog, or file a new issue that should be worked.

# Issue Priorities and Queue Placement

Three pieces of issue metadata decide whether an issue is worked and when. Two
of them behave differently from what their names suggest, and the difference is
silent — a mis-set issue looks correctly prioritized in the GitHub UI and is
scheduled exactly as it was before.

Read this before setting priority on anything.

## The one-paragraph version

An issue is invisible to the orchestrator until it carries an `agent:*` label.
Once visible, it is ordered by **milestone, then the `[Px-nnn]` prefix in its
title, then work-blocked dependency fan-out, then issue number** — and the `priority:high` / `priority:medium` /
`priority:low` labels take no part in that ordering at all.

## What each piece actually does

### `agent:*` label — required for pickup

The `agents:` block in `.issue-orchestrator/config/modes/<mode>/main.yaml` is
keyed by label name (`agent:backend`, `agent:frontend`, `agent:mobile`, …). The
label **is** the routing key: it selects the prompt, provider, model, timeout
and reviewer for the session.

No `agent:*` label means the planner never considers the issue, no matter what
else it carries. This is the single most common reason a "high priority" issue
sits untouched.

> The GitHub descriptions on these labels still read *"Test data for
> integration tests"*. That text is stale. They are the real production routing
> labels.

### Milestone — the primary sort key, and a trap when absent

`MilestoneNumberStrategy.get_sort_key` (`control/scheduler.py`) extracts the
first integer from the milestone name, so `M9` sorts before `M10` numerically
rather than alphabetically.

An issue **with no milestone returns `float("inf")` and sorts behind every
milestoned issue in the repo**. For a backlog of this size that is
indistinguishable from never. Assigning a milestone is usually the change that
actually moves an issue up the queue.

### Title `[Px-nnn]` prefix — the real priority dial

`_get_priority_value` and `_get_sequence_value` parse the tier and sequence out
of the **issue title**, not from any label:

```
\[P(\d)-\d+\]      tier regex     P0 is highest, P9 lowest
\[P\d-(\d+)\]      sequence regex ascending within a tier
```

No match falls back to `scheduling.default_priority_tier`, which is **1**
(`infra/settings_schema.py`; its own doc note says *"Used when issue titles do
not include a [P?-nnn] prefix"*).

**A bare `[P0]` does not match.** The regex requires the `-nnn` sequence, so a
title like `[P0] Fix the thing` is decorative — it silently schedules at the
default tier while reading as top priority to every human who sees it.

### `priority:*` labels — a human signal only

`priority:high`, `priority:medium` and `priority:low` are provisioned by
`LabelManager.repository_initialization_labels` and carried by many issues, but
**nothing in `sort_by_priority` reads them**. Set them so the backlog is legible
to people; never report that setting one changed scheduling.

## Full sort order

`Scheduler.sort_by_priority` builds the key in this order:

1. **Milestone** — configured order map if present, else the strategy's key; no
   milestone sorts last.
2. **Priority tier** — `[P(\d)-` from the title, else `default_priority_tier`.
3. **Sequence** — `-(\d+)]` from the title, else `float("inf")` (sorts last
   within its tier).
4. **Dependency fan-out**, descending: unique open transitive dependents whose
   work gates are blocked, supplied by the live planner.
5. **Issue number**, ascending, as the final tie-break.

`pick_next_batch` then takes from the front, after any explicit
`priority_overrides` (issue numbers, jumped to the head of the batch).

### Ordering is not gating

With equal milestone, title priority and dependency fan-out, ties break by
**ascending issue number**. Filing a prerequisite later does not by itself
move it ahead; declared work-blocking dependencies contribute scheduling
weight only after the explicit milestone and title priorities tie.

**Ordering does not stop the dependent from starting.** Sorting only decides
who is picked first among issues that are already eligible. With two free
slots, `pick_next_batch` takes both — so the dependent can start before its
prerequisite is finished no matter how they sort.

**To gate, declare the dependency.** Put it in the dependent's body:

```
Depends-on: #7160
```

An issue is runnable only when **all** its `Depends-on:` dependencies are
closed, so this holds #7152 back until #7160 is done, whatever the numbers or
sequence say. `Depends-on: M1-010` resolves the same way via the external ID
in the title.

(`Stack-after:` is a different edge with a weaker condition — a predecessor
unblocks on a usable branch rather than on closure. Use `Depends-on:` when you
mean "not until that is finished"; see ADR-0029 for the stacked-work case.)

One restriction, and it bites in three ways. The dependency must be in the
**same milestone** as the dependent, or in the foundation milestone
(`milestones.foundation`, default `M0`). Otherwise it is `CROSS_MILESTONE`,
which **blocks** the issue rather than ordering it:

| Situation | Result |
|---|---|
| Dependency in another milestone | `CROSS_MILESTONE` — blocked |
| **Dependent itself has no milestone** | `CROSS_MILESTONE` — blocked, because the edge cannot be evaluated at all |
| Dependency has no milestone, dependent does | `CROSS_MILESTONE` — blocked |

The middle row is the one that surprises people, and it interacts with the
"no milestone" note above: an unmilestoned issue with no dependencies merely
sorts last, but an unmilestoned issue carrying a `Depends-on:` line is hard
blocked. Filing a follow-up without a milestone and adding a dependency to it
is the usual way to reach that state.

See [FAQ Q22](../../../docs/user/faq.md) and
[ADR-0029](../../../docs/architecture/ADR/0029-stacked-work-via-typed-dependency-edges.md).

Sequence numbers remain useful, but for what they are: choosing the order
among eligible issues. Use them when you want a stable running order, not
when you need one issue to wait for another.

## How to do it

### Prioritize an existing issue

1. **Check the work belongs to this repo.** An agent launched here works in
   this repo's worktree. An issue whose real work lives in another repository
   burns a session and completes nothing — label it there, or leave it as a
   tracker. This check comes first because it is the one that wastes the most.
2. Add the `agent:*` label that routes to the right prompt/provider.
3. Assign a milestone, or accept that it sorts last.
4. Add the `priority:*` label for the humans.
5. Only if it must jump its milestone's queue, add a `[Px-nnn]` title prefix.
   Raising an issue above the rest of its milestone is a judgment call about
   what gets displaced — surface it rather than deciding silently.

```bash
gh issue edit <N> --repo <owner>/<repo> \
  --add-label "agent:backend" \
  --add-label "priority:high" \
  --milestone "M11: Validation, Test Infra, And Dev Guardrails"
```

### Allocate a sequence number

Sequences run as one counter per tier across the whole repo, not per milestone.
Check **open and closed** issues so a closed issue's number is not reused:

```bash
gh issue list --repo <owner>/<repo> --state all --limit 600 \
  --json number,title,state \
  --jq '.[] | select(.title | test("\\[P0-")) | "\(.number)\t\(.state)\t\(.title)"'
```

Take the next unused number. Duplicates are not fatal — the issue-number
tie-break keeps the order deterministic — but they make the backlog misleading.

### Audit for malformed prefixes

Finds titles that look prioritized but do not match the tier regex:

```bash
gh issue list --repo <owner>/<repo> --state open --limit 400 \
  --json number,title --jq '.[] | "\(.number)\t\(.title)"' \
| python3 -c '
import re, sys
canonical = re.compile(r"\[P(\d)-\d+\]")
suspect = re.compile(r"(\[\s*[Pp]\s*\d|\(\s*[Pp]\d|\[[Pp]\d[^-\]]|\[[Pp]\d-\D)")
for line in sys.stdin:
    number, title = line.rstrip("\n").split("\t", 1)
    if not canonical.search(title) and suspect.search(title):
        print(f"#{number}  {title}")
'
```

When repairing one, **copy the existing title and change only the prefix**.
Retyping the tail from a truncated listing silently rewrites the issue's
wording.

### Diagnose "why was this never picked up?"

In order, stopping at the first hit:

1. No `agent:*` label → invisible to the planner. This is nearly always it.
2. No milestone → sorts behind every milestoned issue, and if the issue also
   carries a `Depends-on:` line it is BLOCKED outright, not merely last (see
   item 5).
3. A blocking label (`blocked`, `blocked-*`, `needs-human`) → held deliberately;
   see the `troubleshooting` skill.
4. An **unmet dependency** → `Depends-on:` in the body naming an issue that is
   still open. The issue is not runnable until every dependency is closed, and
   this looks exactly like "never picked up" because nothing about its labels
   or ordering is wrong.
5. A **`CROSS_MILESTONE` dependency** → the edge cannot be evaluated against
   the milestone rules. Three ways in: the named issue is in another
   milestone; the named issue has no milestone while this one does; or **this
   issue has no milestone at all**, which makes every `Depends-on:` on it
   unevaluable. All three BLOCK rather than order.
6. Ordered correctly but behind a long queue → check tier and sequence, and
   confirm `max_concurrent_sessions` is not saturated.
