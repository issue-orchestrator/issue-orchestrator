# ADR 0034: SandboxScope — orchestrator-computed per-session agent sandbox

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2026-07-19
**Tracking issue:** #6859
**Related:** ADR-0031 (triage tech lead), ADR-0033 / #6858 (tech-lead run representation)

## Context

Every claude-code agent (backend/frontend/mobile/triage) runs
`permission_mode: bypassPermissions` — full local machine access, no OS
isolation. The god-view (ADR-0031 evidence-map) makes the **tech-lead the
broadest-read agent**, which makes it the *worst* one to leave un-sandboxed
(broad read + any egress = an exfiltration channel). The current containment
(env-var scrubbing + hooks) is defense-in-depth, **not** a boundary — the code
says so explicitly (`execution/agent_runner_env.py`: "not isolation… same-user
agents share HOME… real isolation requires OS-level").

Two forces make this actionable now:

1. **Remove yolo** — a real safety requirement, and not just for the tech-lead:
   *every* agent runs yolo today.
2. **Enable a fair codex/claude-code A/B** for the tech-lead — codex's default
   `workspace-write` sandbox *blinds* the god-view (can't reach the substrate),
   and the two CLIs must run under the *same* posture for the comparison to
   measure reasoning rather than sandbox luck.

The tension we resolved: the god-view needs *broad* reads; a sandbox wants
*bounded* access. The insight is that **bounded is the security property, not
read-only** — and the substrate scope is already computed (the evidence-map).

## Decision

Introduce **`SandboxScope`** as a first-class owner in the **session-launch**
path, beside worktree-prep / decoupled-scratch / provider-args.

- The orchestrator **computes a per-session scope** (`read/write roots`,
  `egress`) from the **agent role**; a **provider adapter** translates it to
  each CLI's flags. It is applied to **all** agents — killing yolo system-wide.
  This is more *orchestrator-authoritative* than a static `bypassPermissions`
  in config: the orchestrator grants exactly what a session needs, per run.
- **Mechanism, symmetric across CLIs:** bounded `--add-dir` /
  `additionalDirectories` of the specific paths a role needs (read **and** write
  is acceptable — bounded is the property that matters), write confined to the
  worktree/scratch, **no arbitrary egress**. claude-code may *optionally* tighten
  reads to read-only (`sandbox.filesystem.allowRead/allowWrite`); not required.
- **Per-role policies:** coder → its worktree; reviewer → the PR worktree;
  **tech-lead → the evidence-map paths (state dir, dbs, run-dirs, base repo,
  logs) + scratch, no egress.** The evidence-map already enumerates the
  tech-lead's read set, so it *is* the read policy.
- **Egress is a per-role flag** (`none | model-only | model+web`). The tech-lead
  defaults **model-only (no web)**: the broadest-read agent gets no egress, and
  web hypotheses become gated "explore" issues (see below). `model+web` is
  documented for later, or for a scoped worker that picks up an explore issue.
- **Credentials denied** in the sandbox (GITHUB_TOKEN, cloud creds) — turns the
  existing env-scrub into a real boundary.

### Why bounded-writable rather than read-only

The "an investigation must not mutate its subject" invariant is already enforced
by **decoupled-scratch** (the tech-lead runs in a throwaway worktree and reads
focus branches via *shared git objects*, not a writable checkout). Exfiltration
is killed by **no-egress**. So within a bounded, no-egress scope, writability
costs ~nothing (trusted first-party agent; the dbs are the orchestrator's own; a
corruption is a bug, not a breach). Bounded `--add-dir` is therefore *tighter*
than codex `disk-full-read-access` — it excludes `$HOME`, other repos, tixmeup —
so it is the better choice even though it is writable.

### Web = no egress for the tech-lead

The broadest-read agent is the worst to give an egress channel, and web research
belongs to *fixing* (the scoped worker's job), not *diagnosing* (the tech-lead's
job). So the tech-lead does not browse; when it hypothesizes an external cause it
files a gated "explore" issue describing what to research — the same
propose-don't-acquire pattern as "file an issue to instrument a missing signal."

## Consequences

- Yolo removed **system-wide**, not just for the tech-lead.
- Filesystem/network **reach becomes orchestrator-authoritative** and
  per-session, consistent with "agents carry intent, orchestrator has authority."
- The codex/claude-code A/B runs under the **same computed posture** —
  equivalence by construction.
- The evidence-map gains a second consumer: it defines both *what the tech-lead
  reads* and *what its sandbox allows*. Composes with decoupled-scratch (scratch
  = the write-root).
- Provider asymmetry to document: claude-code can bound reads read-only; codex's
  read is coarser (workspace or full-disk), so codex uses bounded writable
  `--add-dir`. Equivalent enough for the comparison; claude-code tighter in prod.

## Capability check (verified 2026-07-19)

- **claude-code:** real OS sandbox (macOS Seatbelt / Linux bubblewrap);
  `--add-dir`/`additionalDirectories` (r+w) or `sandbox.filesystem.allowRead/
  allowWrite` (bounded read-only); `network.allowedDomains` + deny
  `WebSearch`/`Bash(curl)`; `credentials.envVars: deny`; `permission_mode:
  dontAsk` (non-yolo + unattended).
- **codex:** `-s read-only|workspace-write|danger-full-access`; `--add-dir`
  (writable extras); `-C/--cd`; `-a never`; broad read via
  `sandbox_permissions=["disk-full-read-access"]`.

## Alternatives considered

- **Keep bypassPermissions (yolo).** Rejected — not isolation; the tech-lead's
  broad read makes it the highest-risk agent to leave open.
- **codex `disk-full-read-access` for the tech-lead.** Rejected as the default —
  unbounded read; bounded `--add-dir` is tighter.
- **Insist on read-only substrate.** Rejected as a *requirement* — decoupled-
  scratch + no-egress already provide the protections read-only would; kept as
  an optional claude-code hardening.
- **Tech-lead-specific sandbox hack.** Rejected — the sandbox is a session-launch
  concern for every agent; a bolt-on would scatter the policy.
