# Developing

You're modifying Issue Orchestrator — adding features, fixing bugs, or extending the system.

## Dev setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BruceBGordon/issue-orchestrator.git
cd issue-orchestrator
make venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest tests/unit/ -x -q    # Verify the unit suite passes
```

If you're working on a feature branch, use a git worktree to keep the base repo clean:

```bash
git worktree add ../issue-orchestrator-wt-my-feature -b my-feature
cd ../issue-orchestrator-wt-my-feature
make worktree-setup
```

## Understand the architecture

**[Architecture diagram](../architecture/README.md)** — The hex diagram shows how everything connects: entry points, control plane, ports, adapters, external systems.

**[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)** — This is the primary conventions guide for contributors. It's written to be directly actionable for coding agents, but the architecture rules and workflow constraints apply equally to humans. The key sections:

| Section | What you'll learn |
|---------|-------------------|
| Architecture Principles | Hexagonal, DI, layered separation, labels as truth, agent intent vs orchestrator authority |
| Key Ports | The foundational Protocol interfaces and a pointer to the full port set in `ports/` |
| Events vs Logs | Structured events drive the UI; logs are for humans. Never parse log text in code. |
| Fail-Fast Design | No fallbacks, no silent degradation. Crash on unexpected state. |
| Conventions | Where ports live, where adapters live, how to test, how to emit events |

## Find what you need to change

The codebase follows strict layered separation:

| Layer | Directory | Responsibility |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| **Control** | `control/` | Decisions, policy, state advancement. Pure logic, no I/O. |
| **Observation** | `observation/` | Gather facts. No decisions, no mutations. |
| **Adapters** | `adapters/` | Concrete external-system integrations. |
| **Execution** | `execution/` | Runtime services, provider factories, and orchestration support code. |
| **Ports** | `ports/` | Protocol interfaces. Contracts between layers. |
| **Domain** | `domain/` | Models, state machines, events. |

If you're adding a new external integration, you'll add a Protocol in `ports/` and a concrete adapter in `adapters/`, then wire it through the composition root and execution/provider layer as needed. If you're changing decision logic, that's `control/`. The runtime facade lives in `infra/orchestrator.py` and should keep delegating rather than owning policy.

## Testing

```bash
pytest tests/unit/ -v              # Full unit suite
pytest tests/unit/test_foo.py -v   # Single file
pytest tests/e2e/ -v               # E2E tests (requires gh auth)
```

**Mock at port boundaries, not internal functions.** Create a mock that implements the Protocol, inject it, test the control logic in isolation. See [Testing Guide](../development/TESTING.md) for patterns and fixtures.

**Import-linter enforces architecture.** Control cannot import execution. Ports cannot import outer layers. If your change violates a boundary, `make validate` will catch it.

## Key workflows to understand

| Topic | Doc | When you need it |
|-------|-----|------------------|
| How agents complete work | `entrypoints/cli_tools/coding_done.py` / `entrypoints/cli_tools/reviewer_done.py` + AGENTS "Agent Intent, Orchestrator Authority" | Modifying completion processing |
| Code review loop | [Review Workflow](../development/REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md) | Modifying review, rework, or triage |
| Hook enforcement | [Hooks Architecture](../architecture/hooks.md) | Modifying safety guardrails |
| State machines | `domain/state_machines/` | Changing issue or review lifecycle |
| Events and observability | AGENTS "Events vs Logs" | Adding new observable behavior |

## Submitting changes

1. Run `make validate-pr` before pushing for the required local publish gate; it is cache-aware and seeds the pre-push validation record
2. CI mirrors `make validate-pr` by splitting the fast validate job and the agent-backed simulated/integration slices across separate required jobs
3. Do not run `_validate-pr` directly; it is the internal uncached suite command used by the cache-aware gate
4. Tests must pass. If tests fail, fix them — don't defer.
5. [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) covers running tests from forks
