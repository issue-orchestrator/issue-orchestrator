# Configuration

Configuration lives in `.issue-orchestrator/config/default.yaml` (or a named config like `main.yaml`).

---

## TL;DR - Starter Config to Get Running

```yaml
agents:
  "agent:dev":
    prompt: ".issue-orchestrator/prompts/dev.md"
    model: "sonnet"

validation:
  quick:
    cmd: "make test"
    timeout_seconds: 300
  publish:
    cmd: "./scripts/validate-pr-suite.sh"
    timeout_seconds: 1800
    dirty_check: tracked
```

Use a private non-recursive publish command when your user-facing
`make validate-pr` target wraps the cache-aware `scripts/verify-pr.sh` path.
That keeps pre-push validation from re-entering itself.

Label an issue with `agent:dev` and start the orchestrator.

Use `validation.quick` for fast coding/review feedback and
`validation.publish` for the authoritative pre-push/pre-publish gate. The
publish dirty-tree policy lives at `validation.publish.dirty_check`.

### Use Claude Opus With XHigh Effort

Set this on `default_agent` to apply it to every agent that does not override
the provider, model, or provider args:

```yaml
default_agent:
  provider: "claude-code"
  model: "opus"
  provider_args:
    effort: "xhigh"
    permission_mode: "bypassPermissions"
```

Or configure one agent directly:

```yaml
agents:
  "agent:backend":
    prompt: ".issue-orchestrator/prompts/backend.md"
    provider: "claude-code"
    model: "opus"
    provider_args:
      effort: "xhigh"
      permission_mode: "bypassPermissions"
```

---

## Environment Variable Substitution

Any string value in config can reference environment variables using `${VAR}` syntax:

```yaml
claims:
  claimant_id: "${ORCHESTRATOR_ID}"    # Expands to value of ORCHESTRATOR_ID env var

repo:
  github:
    token_env: "${GITHUB_TOKEN_VAR}"   # Works in any string field
```

If the referenced environment variable is not set, config loading fails with a clear error message showing which variable is missing and where it was referenced.

---

## Common Additions

### Limit Concurrency

```yaml
execution:
  concurrency:
    max_concurrent_sessions: 2
```

### Only Process Specific Issues

```yaml
filtering:
  label: "bot-ready"
  milestones: ["M1", "M2"]
  exclude_labels: ["test-data"]
```

### Milestone Sort Strategy

```yaml
milestones:
  sort: "milestone_number"   # default: extracts first integer from title (M1 < M2 < M10)
  # sort: "due_date"         # opt-in: sort by milestone due date; ties fall through to the remaining scheduler keys
  # sort: "pattern"          # opt-in: custom regex, requires sort_config.pattern
  # sort: "name"             # opt-in: alphabetic by milestone title
  # order: ["M0", "M1"]      # optional: explicit order for listed milestones (overrides sort)
  foundation: "M0"
```

The full sort key is `(milestone_key, priority_tier, sequence, issue.number)` — each layer only tie-breaks when the previous one ties.

`milestone_number` is the default because it works whether or not milestones have due dates. `due_date` only sorts meaningfully when every milestone has a `dueOn` set; otherwise due-less milestones tie on the milestone key and ordering falls through to priority tier (from `[Px-nnn]` in the title), then sequence, then issue number.

### Enable Code Review

```yaml
review:
  enabled: true
  default: "agent:reviewer"

agents:
  "agent:reviewer":
    prompt: ".issue-orchestrator/prompts/reviewer.md"
    model: "sonnet"
```

### Declare Repo-Scoped GitHub Auth

```yaml
repo:
  name: "BruceBGordon/tixmeup"
  github:
    token_env: "TIXMEUP_GITHUB_TOKEN"
    keyring_service: "tixmeup-github"
    keyring_username: "${USER}"
```

Use `token_env` when the repo should read a specific environment variable.
Use `keyring_service` and `keyring_username` when the repo should read a
specific OS keyring entry. You can declare one or both.

When a repo declares `repo.github.token_env` or `repo.github.keyring_*`,
those sources become authoritative:
- `doctor` validates the configured source instead of a random global token
- Control Center start checks validate access to `repo.name`, not just `/user`
- startup fails clearly if the repo-scoped source is missing, instead of
  silently falling back to another token that may not have repo access

Control Center starts repository engines directly through the orchestrator
supervisor. It does not run target-repo wrapper scripts, so script-only token
exports are not available to Control Center-launched engines. Use `token_env`
only when the variable is already present in the Control Center process
environment; add `keyring_service` and `keyring_username` for a durable
per-repo Keychain fallback.

### Ignore Repo-Local Runtime Artifacts

Use `.issue-orchestrator/runtime-ignore` when a tool writes repo-local runtime
files that should not block agent completion, pre-push dirty checks, or plain
agent `git status` output.

```text
# .issue-orchestrator/runtime-ignore
.tool/runtime.lock
cache/runtime/
*.tmp
```

Patterns are repo-relative. Blank lines and `#` comments are ignored. `!`
negations are not supported and are logged as a warning; the file is an
additive runtime-artifact list, not a full `.gitignore` replacement. Glob
patterns use lightweight matching: `*` may match path separators, so
`cache/*.json` also matches files in subdirectories of `cache/`.

The orchestrator always ignores its built-in runtime artifacts, including
`.issue-orchestrator/` session state and `.claude/scheduled_tasks.lock`. Add to
`runtime-ignore` only for additional files created by your repo's tools or agent
runtime. Do not list source files, generated artifacts that should be reviewed,
or anything the agent is expected to commit.

## What To Read Next

- Full reference (auto-generated): `docs/user/configuration_reference.md`
- Complete example config: `examples/config.example.yaml`

---

## Advanced Options (Teaser)

You can configure much more than the minimal setup, including:
- Automated code review and triage workflows
- E2E test runner with flake tracking
- Multi-orchestrator coordination (claims)
- Provider resilience (retry + circuit breaker)
- Observability thresholds and escalation
- Hook enforcement and safety guardrails

The web Settings dialog (when `ui.mode: web`) is always available, and you can always edit the raw YAML config file directly.
If you want to revisit setup, you can rerun the setup wizard on an existing config at any time.

---

## Settings Dialog Reference

The web dashboard settings dialog is driven by `src/issue_orchestrator/infra/settings_schema.py`. The schema is the single source of truth for:
- Settings HTML form fields (rendered via Jinja2)
- GET/POST `/api/settings` serialization and validation
- Setup wizard defaults and labels
- Doctor checks (path validation, agent references)
- Documentation reference (auto-generated)

Goal Pilot uses the standard agent configuration: define its prompt under `agents` and reference the label via `goal_pilot.agent`.
