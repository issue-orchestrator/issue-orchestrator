# GitHub Auth and Permissions

## Quick Start

```bash
export ISSUE_ORCH_GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

This is the simple local mode: issue-orchestrator acts through your GitHub
identity. It is the right first setup for trials, personal repos without strict
approval rules, and teams where someone other than the token owner reviews the
PR.

## Authentication Modes

### Simple Mode: Personal Token

Use a fine-grained PAT, GitHub CLI auth, or the OS keychain when you are
comfortable with orchestrator-created branches and PRs being attributed to the
token owner.

This mode is supported today. It has one important branch-protection limit:
GitHub will not let a PR author approve their own PR. If your repo requires all
PRs to be approved and the orchestrator opens PRs as you, you will need another
eligible reviewer or an admin bypass.

### Protected-Branch Mode: GitHub App

For real protected-branch workflows where you want to approve agent PRs
yourself, use a GitHub App installation identity. The app opens branches and
PRs as `your-app-name[bot]`; you remain the human reviewer, so GitHub does not
treat the approval as self-approval.

This is the recommended target model for bot-authored PRs. First-class GitHub
App configuration is supported through `repo.github.app`. In App mode,
issue-orchestrator uses installation tokens for GitHub REST/GraphQL calls and
for orchestrator-owned `git push` during publish, so created branches and PRs
are authored by the app/bot identity.

In the self-hosted/local model, each user or organization creates its own
GitHub App. Do not share an issue-orchestrator private key with other users. A
single public issue-orchestrator app would only make sense for a hosted service
that securely holds the app private key and mints installation tokens for
installed accounts.

## Creating a Personal Token

### Option 1: Fine-Grained PAT

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new
2. Select the repository
3. Set permissions:

| Permission | Access |
|------------|--------|
| Contents | Read and write |
| Issues | Read and write |
| Pull requests | Read and write |
| Metadata | Read (automatic) |

### Option 2: Classic PAT

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. Select `repo` scope

## Planning a GitHub App

Use a GitHub App when branch protection requires approvals and the normal human
operator should be able to approve agent-created PRs.

Create the app in the account that owns the target repositories, or create an
app that can be installed on any account and install it separately on each
owner account. Each account installation has its own installation ID.

Recommended repository permissions:

| Permission | Access |
|------------|--------|
| Contents | Read and write |
| Issues | Read and write |
| Pull requests | Read and write |
| Metadata | Read (automatic) |
| Checks | Read |
| Commit statuses | Read |

GitHub App UI settings for this use case:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation | Off |
| Enable Device Flow | Off |
| Expire user authorization tokens | Leave default; unused |
| Callback URL | Leave blank if allowed, otherwise use the repo URL |
| Webhook Active | Off unless you are building webhook-driven orchestration |

Install with **Only select repositories** and grant access only to repos the
orchestrator should manage. For separate ownership boundaries, such as a
personal repo and an organization repo, prefer separate apps unless you
intentionally want one credential spanning both accounts.

Configure the target repo after installation:

```yaml
repo:
  name: "issue-orchestrator/issue-orchestrator"
  github:
    app:
      client_id: "Iv23..."
      app_id: "4250697"          # optional fallback / metadata
      installation_id: "145305179"
      private_key_path: "~/.config/issue-orchestrator/github-apps/issue-orchestrator-bot.private-key.pem"
```

`client_id` is the preferred JWT issuer. Keep the private key outside the repo
and restrict it to the local operator account, for example:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/issue-orchestrator/github-apps
chmod 700 ~/.config/issue-orchestrator ~/.config/issue-orchestrator/github-apps
chmod 600 ~/.config/issue-orchestrator/github-apps/issue-orchestrator-bot.private-key.pem
```

Alternatively, store the PEM contents in an environment variable and use
`private_key_env` instead of `private_key_path`.

## Rotating an Expiring Token

If GitHub warns that a token is expiring, generate an equivalent token when
GitHub offers that option. Then update the auth source that issue-orchestrator
actually uses:

- exported env var: replace the variable and restart the process
- repo-scoped Keychain entry: replace the configured service/account entry
- global keychain fallback: rerun `issue-orchestrator auth store`
- GitHub CLI auth: refresh the relevant `gh auth` login

Run `issue-orchestrator --config <config-path> doctor` afterward and confirm it
authenticates to the target repo. For the exact resolution order and Keychain
commands, see [GitHub Auth Setup (Developer)](../development/GITHUB_TOKEN_SETUP.md#rotate-an-expiring-token).

## Agent Credentials

**Agents get no GitHub token.** The orchestrator handles all GitHub operations.

See [ADR-0005](../architecture/ADR/0005-human-merge-and-agent-credential-isolation.md) and [ADR-0016](../architecture/ADR/0016-orchestrator-as-mediator.md) for why.
